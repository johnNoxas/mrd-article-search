40122885,Bemcentinib as monotherapy and in combination with low-dose cytarabine in acute myeloid leukemia patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy: a phase 1b/2a trial.,"Loges Sonja, Heuser Michael, Chromik Jörg, Sutamtewagul Grerk, Kapp-Schwoerer Silke, Crugnola Monica, Di Renzo Nicola, Lemoli Roberto, Mattei Daniele, Fiedler Walter, Alvarado-Valero Yesid, Ben-Batalla Isabel, Waizenegger Jonas, Rieckmann Lisa-Marie, Janning Melanie, Collienne Maike, Imbusch Charles D, Beumer Niklas, Micklem David, H Nilsson Linn, Madeleine Noëlly, McCracken Nigel, Oliva Cristina, Gorcea-Carson Claudia, Gjertsen Bjørn T",Nature communications,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Mar', 'Day': '23'}","Beyond first line, the prognosis of relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients is poor with limited treatment options. Bemcentinib is an orally bioavailable, potent, highly selective inhibitor of AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with poor prognosis, chemotherapy resistance and decreased antitumor immune response. We report bemcentinib monotherapy and bemcentinib+low-dose cytarabine combination therapy arms from the completed BerGenBio-funded open-label Phase 1/2b trial NCT02488408 ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ), in patients unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy. The primary objective in the monotherapy arm was identification of maximum tolerated dose with secondary objectives to identify dose-limiting toxicities, safety and efficacy, and bemcentinib pharmacokinetic profile. In the combination arm, the primary objective was safety and tolerability, with efficacy and pharmacokinetics as secondary objectives. Safety and tolerability were based on standard clinical laboratory safety tests and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. Bemcentinib monotherapy (32 R/R, 2 treatment-naïve AML and 2 myelodysplasia patients) was well-tolerated and a loading/maintenance dose of 400/200 mg was selected for combination treatment, comprising 30 R/R and 6 treatment-naïve AML patients. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were cytopenia, febrile neutropenia and asymptomatic QTcF prolongation, with no grade 5 events reported. In conclusion, bemcentinib+low-dose cytarabine was safe and well tolerated.","Journal Article, Clinical Trial, Phase I, Clinical Trial, Phase II, Multicenter Study","Humans, Cytarabine, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Middle Aged, Female, Aged, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, Adult, Axl Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, Maximum Tolerated Dose, Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, Proto-Oncogene Proteins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT02488408']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase I', attributes={'UI': 'D017426'}), StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase II', attributes={'UI': 'D017427'}), StringElement('Multicenter Study', attributes={'UI': 'D016448'})]"

However, clinical outcomes are unsatisfied for patients with intermediate/adverse cytogenetics based on European Leukemia Net (ELN) risk stratification 2022 (ELN 2022), and relapses also remain common even in patients with favorable-risk cytogenetics with measurable residual disease (MRD). There is an urgent unmet need for optimizing intensive chemotherapy regimens with novel agents, to enhance the MRD-negative rate, achieve durable remission, and improve the prognosis of AML. Preliminary results showed that adding a B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor to intensive chemotherapy could improve treatment efficacy. Sonrotoclax is a potent, selective, next-generation BCL-2 inhibitor that effectively inhibits both the wide-type BCL-2 and several BCL-2 mutants. We hypothesize that the addition of sonrotoclax to intensive chemotherapy may enhance the treatment efficacy for AML without untoward toxicity. Here, we describe the rationale and design of a single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of sonrotoclax combined with chemotherapy as an induction therapy in newly diagnosed patients with AML who are fit for intensive chemotherapy, followed by stratified subsequent consolidation and maintenance treatment based on patients' ELN2022 at diagnosis and MRD results after induction.<b>Clinical Trail Registration</b>: NCT06497062.","Journal Article, Clinical Trial Protocol, Multicenter Study","Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2, Adult, Female, Male, Middle Aged, Aged, Treatment Outcome, Risk Assessment, Indoles, Young Adult, Neoplasm, Residual","['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'B-cell lymphoma-2 inhibitor', 'European Leukemia Net', 'intensive chemotherapy', 'measurable residual disease', 'risk stratification', 'sonrotoclax']","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT06497062']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Clinical Trial Protocol', attributes={'UI': 'D000078325'}), StringElement('Multicenter Study', attributes={'UI': 'D016448'})]"

Tumor dependence on Mcl-1 is associated with resistance to venetoclax. Voruciclib, an oral cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor targeting CDK9, indirectly decreases Mcl-1 protein expression and synergizes with venetoclax in preclinical models. This dose escalation study evaluated voruciclib in patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies. Initially, voruciclib was administered daily, continuously, on a 28-day cycle (group 1). After 2 patients with prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of interstitial pneumonitis at 100 mg, voruciclib administration was changed to days 1 to 14 of a 28-day cycle (group 2). Forty patients, 21 with AML and 19 with B-cell malignancies, were enrolled. Patients had a median of 3 prior lines of therapy (range, 1-8). Dose escalation in group 2 was stopped at 200 mg, a dose that achieved plasma concentrations sufficient for target inhibition, without DLTs observed. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (30%), nausea (25%), anemia (22%), fatigue (22%), constipation (17%), dizziness (15%), and dyspnea (15%). In AML, 1 patient achieved a morphologic leukemia-free state, and 2 had stable disease. Voruciclib treatment led to a decrease in MCL1 messenger RNA expression, downregulation of myelocytomatosis (MYC) and NF-κB transcriptional gene sets, and reduced phosphorylation of RNA polymerase 2. Voruciclib on intermittent dosing was well tolerated, with no DLTs, paving the way for evaluation of the combination of voruciclib with venetoclax for patients with previously treated AML.

The objectives were to define the impact of ATO on early deaths and relapses and its optimal positioning in the overall treatment strategy. In a 21.5-year period, 324 males and 323 females at a median age of 45.5 years (range, 18.1-91.8; low/intermediate risk, n = 448; high risk, n = 199) were treated. Regimens included frontline all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)/chemotherapy and maintenance with/without ATO (n = 436), ATRA/IV-ATO/chemotherapy (ATRA/IV-ATO; n = 61), and ATRA/oral-ATO/ascorbic acid with ATO maintenance (oral-AAA; n = 150).
