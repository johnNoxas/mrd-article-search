Bemcentinib is an orally bioavailable, potent, highly selective inhibitor of AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with poor prognosis, chemotherapy resistance and decreased antitumor immune response. We report bemcentinib monotherapy and bemcentinib+low-dose cytarabine combination therapy arms from the completed BerGenBio-funded open-label Phase 1/2b trial NCT02488408 ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ), in patients unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy. The primary objective in the monotherapy arm was identification of maximum tolerated dose with secondary objectives to identify dose-limiting toxicities, safety and efficacy, and bemcentinib pharmacokinetic profile. In the combination arm, the primary objective was safety and tolerability, with efficacy and pharmacokinetics as secondary objectives. Safety and tolerability were based on standard clinical laboratory safety tests and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. Bemcentinib monotherapy (32 R/R, 2 treatment-naïve AML and 2 myelodysplasia patients) was well-tolerated and a loading/maintenance dose of 400/200 mg was selected for combination treatment, comprising 30 R/R and 6 treatment-naïve AML patients. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were cytopenia, febrile neutropenia and asymptomatic QTcF prolongation, with no grade 5 events reported. In conclusion, bemcentinib+low-dose cytarabine was safe and well tolerated.","Journal Article, Clinical Trial, Phase I, Clinical Trial, Phase II, Multicenter Study","Humans, Cytarabine, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Middle Aged, Female, Aged, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, Adult, Axl Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, Maximum Tolerated Dose, Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, Proto-Oncogene Proteins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT02488408']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase I', attributes={'UI': 'D017426'}), StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase II', attributes={'UI': 'D017427'}), StringElement('Multicenter Study', attributes={'UI': 'D016448'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02488408,A Phase Ib/II Multicenter Open-label Study of Bemcentinib (BGB324) in Patients With AML or MDS,A Phase Ib/II Multicenter Open-label Study of BGB324 as a Single Agent and in Combination With Cytarabine or Decitabine in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia or as a Single Agent in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome,"A Phase Ib/II multicentre open label study of bemcentinib (BGB324) as a single agent in participants with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or in a combination with cytarabine or decitabine in AML participants.

However, clinical outcomes are unsatisfied for patients with intermediate/adverse cytogenetics based on European Leukemia Net (ELN) risk stratification 2022 (ELN 2022), and relapses also remain common even in patients with favorable-risk cytogenetics with measurable residual disease (MRD). There is an urgent unmet need for optimizing intensive chemotherapy regimens with novel agents, to enhance the MRD-negative rate, achieve durable remission, and improve the prognosis of AML. Preliminary results showed that adding a B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor to intensive chemotherapy could improve treatment efficacy. Sonrotoclax is a potent, selective, next-generation BCL-2 inhibitor that effectively inhibits both the wide-type BCL-2 and several BCL-2 mutants.

Tumor dependence on Mcl-1 is associated with resistance to venetoclax. Voruciclib, an oral cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor targeting CDK9, indirectly decreases Mcl-1 protein expression and synergizes with venetoclax in preclinical models. This dose escalation study evaluated voruciclib in patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies. Initially, voruciclib was administered daily, continuously, on a 28-day cycle (group 1). After 2 patients with prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of interstitial pneumonitis at 100 mg, voruciclib administration was changed to days 1 to 14 of a 28-day cycle (group 2). Forty patients, 21 with AML and 19 with B-cell malignancies, were enrolled. Patients had a median of 3 prior lines of therapy (range, 1-8). Dose escalation in group 2 was stopped at 200 mg, a dose that achieved plasma concentrations sufficient for target inhibition, without DLTs observed. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (30%), nausea (25%), anemia (22%), fatigue (22%), constipation (17%), dizziness (15%), and dyspnea (15%). In AML, 1 patient achieved a morphologic leukemia-free state, and 2 had stable disease. Voruciclib treatment led to a decrease in MCL1 messenger RNA expression, downregulation of myelocytomatosis (MYC) and NF-κB transcriptional gene sets, and reduced phosphorylation of RNA polymerase 2. Voruciclib on intermittent dosing was well tolerated, with no DLTs, paving the way for evaluation of the combination of voruciclib with venetoclax for patients with previously treated AML.

This phase 1b study evaluated lower-intensity CPX-351 combined with venetoclax in adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) considered unfit/ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. In a dose-exploration phase using a 3+3 design, patients received stepwise dosing of CPX-351 IV on days 1 and 3 plus venetoclax 400 mg orally on days 2 to 21 per cycle to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for this combination. During the expansion phase, additional patients received CPX-351 plus venetoclax at the identified RP2D. The primary end points were the RP2D and safety of CPX-351 combined with venetoclax. Secondary end points included preliminary efficacy and pharmacokinetics. Overall, 35 patients were enrolled in the study. A RP2D of CPX-351 30 units/m2 (daunorubicin 13.2 mg/m2 and cytarabine 30 mg/m2) plus venetoclax 400 mg was established. The safety profile of the combination was consistent with the known safety profiles of CPX-351 and venetoclax. Complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) was achieved by 17 of 35 patients (49%), all after cycle 1; of these, 14 were negative for measurable residual disease.

One aspect of leukaemic cell resistance to chemotherapy is the development of clones with increased capacity to respond to cellular stress and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thanks in particular to a high aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) 1A1/2 activity. At diagnosis, ROS level and ALDH1A1/2 activity in AML patients BM are correlated with the different ELN 2022 prognostic groups and overall survival (OS). A significant lower ALDH1A1/2 activity in BM was observed in the favourable ELN2022 subgroup compared to the intermediate and adverse group (p < 0.01). In the same way, the ROS levels were significantly lower in the favourable ELN 2022 subgroup compared to the intermediate group (p < 0.0001) and adverse group (p < 0.0002). ROS<sup>high</sup> AML patients had a significantly lower median overall survival (OS) (8.2 months) than ROS<sup>low</sup> patients (24.6 months) (p = 0.0368). After first-line therapy, a significant increase of ROS level (p = 0.015) and ALDH1A1/2 activity (0 = 0.0273) in leukaemic blasts was observed, especially in the refractory ones. ABD-3001, a competitive and irreversible inhibitor of ALDHs 1 and 3, can in vitro inhibit the proliferation of patient-derived leukaemic cells in accordance with redox balance. In multivariate analysis, ROS level was the most significant (p < 0.05) and the strongest predictive factor for the sensitivity of cells to ABD-3001.

WWP1 overexpression in AML confers a proliferative advantage to leukemic blasts (abnormal immature white blood cells) and counteracts apoptotic cell death and differentiation. In an effort to elucidate the molecular basis of WWP1 oncogenic activities, we identified WWP1 as a previously unknown negative regulator of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in AML cells. TXNIP inhibits the disulfide reductase enzymatic activity of thioredoxin (Trx), impairing its antioxidant function and, ultimately, leading to the disruption of cellular redox homeostasis. In addition, TXNIP restricts cell growth and survival by blocking glucose uptake and metabolism. Here, we found that WWP1 directly interacts with TXNIP, thus promoting its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal proteolysis. As a result, accumulation of TXNIP in response to WWP1 inactivation in AML blasts reduces Trx activity and increases ROS production, hence inducing cellular oxidative stress. Increased ROS generation in WWP1-depleted cells culminates in DNA strand breaks and subsequent apoptosis. Coherently with TXNIP stabilization following WWP1 inactivation, we also observed an impairment of both glucose up-take and consumption. Hence, a contribution to the increased cell death observed in WWP1-depleted cells also possibly arises from the attenuation of glucose up-take and glycolytic flux resulting from TXNIP accumulation. Future studies are needed to establish whether TXNIP-dependent deregulation of redox homeostasis in WWP1-overexpressing blasts may affect the response of leukemic cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.",Journal Article,"Humans, Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Oxidation-Reduction, Carrier Proteins, Reactive Oxygen Species, Thioredoxins, Cell Line, Tumor","ListElement([StringElement('HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('ROS', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('acute myeloid leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('protein ubiquitination', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('redox homeostasis', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'RefSeq', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NM_006472.6']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'})]",RefSeq,NM_006472.6,,,,,,,,,,

However, identifying patients likely to respond remains a challenge, especially for those with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. We evaluated the utility of ex vivo venetoclax sensitivity testing to predict treatment responses to venetoclax-azacitidine in a prospective, multicenter, phase 2 trial. The trial recruited 104 participants with previously untreated (n = 48), R/R (n = 39), or previously treated secondary AML (sAML) (n = 17). The primary end point was complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi) rate in ex vivo sensitive trial participants during the first 3 therapy cycles. The key secondary end points included the correlations between ex vivo drug sensitivity, responses, and survival. Venetoclax sensitivity was successfully assessed in 102 of 104 participants, with results available within a median of 3 days from sampling. In previously untreated AML, ex vivo sensitivity corresponded to an 85% (34/40) CR/CRi rate, with a median overall survival (OS) of 28.7 months, compared with 5.5 months for ex vivo resistant patients (P = .002). For R/R/sAML, ex vivo sensitivity resulted in a 62% CR/CRi rate (21/34) and median OS of 9.7 vs 3.3 months for ex vivo resistant patients (P < .001). In univariate and multivariate analysis, ex vivo venetoclax sensitivity was the strongest predictor for a favorable treatment response and survival. This trial demonstrates the feasibility of integrating ex vivo drug testing into clinical practice to identify patients with AML, particularly in the R/R setting, who benefit from venetoclax.

So far, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in AML has not recapitulated the efficacy seen in B cell malignancies. Here we report a pilot study of autologous anti-CD123 CAR T cells in 12 adults with relapsed or refractory AML. CAR T cells targeting CD123<sup>+</sup> cells were successfully manufactured in 90.4% of runs. Cytokine release syndrome was observed in 10 of 12 infused individuals (83.3%, 90% confidence interval 0.5-0.97). Three individuals achieved clinical response (25%, 90% confidence interval 0.07-0.53). We found that myeloid-supporting cytokines are secreted during cell therapy and support AML blast survival via kinase signaling, leading to CAR T cell exhaustion. The prosurvival effect of therapy-induced cytokines presents a unique resistance mechanism in AML that is distinct from any observed in B cell malignancies. Our findings suggest that autologous CART manufacturing is feasible in AML, but treatment is associated with high rates of cytokine release syndrome and relatively poor clinical efficacy.

The bone marrow is the place or factory in the body where components of blood such as red cells, platelets and white cells are made. In bone marrow failure, the ability of the bone marrow to make these cells is decreased. The decreased bone marrow function is the result from abnormalities that develop in the malignant cells which prevent the normal maturation process by which bone marrow cells develop into red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. The malignant cells in the bone marrow are not good at maturing to make the components of the blood that you need, they occupy space in the bone marrow and prevent the function of remaining normal bone marrow cells.

DNA is a chemical substance within cells that stores information needed for cell growth and cell behavior. One approach to treating the malignant cells is to give chemotherapy which damages DNA within these cells and causes their death. Unfortunately, such therapy has side-effects, since even normal cells can be affected by the treatment.

Reasons for this decision include host factors (comorbidities, reduced performance status, functional limitations due to age), leading to often poor tolerance of repeated chemotherapy courses and the unfavorable biology underlying this disease in older patients. Low dose Decitabine has shown very promising efficacy in high-risk MDS and is therefore a very promising approach also in older AML patients. Preliminary results from several centres have demonstrated excellent feasibility and good efficacy of this treatment.

Here, we investigated whether ruxolitinib and decitabine plus modified busulfan-cyclophosphamide (mBu/Cy) conditioning could reduce relapse in high-risk AML after allo-HSCT. This prospective, single-arm, phase II trial enrolled 37 patients who received allo-HSCT between September 2020 and March 2022 at the First Medical Center of Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital. Eligible patients (10-62 years) had relapsed/refractory, positive measurable residual disease (MRD) prior to conditioning or adverse genetic abnormalities. Ruxolitinib (35 mg twice daily, days - 15 to - 10) and decitabine (20 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day, days - 15 to - 10) were administered followed by mBu/Cy conditioning. All patients achieved engraftment. The cumulative incidences (CIs) of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II-IV and III-IV were 35.0% and 10.5%, respectively. The 1-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 8.1%. The 1-year CI of relapse was 29.7% among all patients, 0% in patients who achieved the first complete remission (CR1) prior to conditioning, and 0% in those with MRD-negative prior to conditioning. The 1-year non-relapse mortality was 5.4%. The 1-year probabilities of overall survival, disease-free survival, and GVHD-free relapse-free survival were 70.3%, 62.2%, and 54.1%, respectively. In conclusion, the novel conditioning showed primary efficacy in terms of a reduction in relapse in high-risk patients with AML after allo-HSCT, especially in those who achieved CR1 and MRD-negative prior to conditioning. Also, the new conditioning regimen may help reduce the incidence of chronic GVHD.

This pooled analysis of the phase 3 VIALE-A trial (NCT02993523) and phase 1b study (NCT02203773) examined prognostic stratification according to the 2017 and 2022 ELN risk classifications and derived new molecular signatures differentiating venetoclax-azacitidine-treated patients based on overall survival (OS). Overall, 279 patients treated with venetoclax-azacitidine and 113 patients treated with placebo-azacitidine were analyzed. The ELN 2017 or 2022 prognostic criteria classified most patients as adverse-risk AML (60.2% and 72.8% for venetoclax-azacitidine and 65.5% and 75.2% for placebo-azacitidine, respectively). Although outcomes with venetoclax-azacitidine improved across all ELN risk groups compared with placebo-azacitidine, ELN classification systems poorly discriminated venetoclax-azacitidine outcomes. By applying a bioinformatic algorithm, new molecular signatures were derived differentiating OS outcomes with venetoclax-azacitidine. The mutational status of TP53, FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), NRAS, and KRAS categorized patients into higher-, intermediate-, and lower-benefit groups (52%, 25%, and 23% of patients, respectively), each associated with a distinct median OS (26.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 20.2-32.7]; 12.1 months [95% CI, 7.3-15.2]; and 5.5 months [95% CI, 2.8-7.6], respectively). ELN prognostic classifiers did not provide clinically meaningful risk stratification of OS outcomes in patients treated with venetoclax-azacitidine.

However, it is not known whether ""niche anchoring"" of LSC affects disease evolution. To address this issue, we conditionally inactivated the adhesion molecule JAM-C (Junctional Adhesion Molecule-C) expressed by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and LSCs in an inducible mixed-lineage leukemia (iMLL)-AF9-driven AML mouse model. Deletion of Jam3 (encoding JAM-C) before induction of the leukemia-initiating iMLL-AF9 fusion resulted in a shift from long-term to short-term HSC expansion, without affecting disease initiation and progression. In vitro experiments showed that JAM-C controlled leukemic cell nesting irrespective of the bone marrow stromal cells used. RNA sequencing performed on leukemic HSCs isolated from diseased mice revealed that genes upregulated in Jam3-deficient animals belonged to activation protein-1 (AP-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)/NF-κB pathways. Human orthologs of dysregulated genes allowed to identify a score that was distinct from, and complementary to, the LSC-17 score. Substratification of patients with AML using LSC-17 and AP-1/TNF-α genes signature defined 4 groups with median survival ranging from <1 year to a median of ""not reached"" after 8 years. Finally, coculture experiments showed that AP-1 activation in leukemic cells was dependent on the nature of stromal cells. Altogether, our results identify the AP-1/TNF-α gene signature as a proxy of LSC anchoring in bone marrow niches, which improves the prognostic value of the LSC-17 score.

JNJ-75276617 (bleximenib) is a novel, orally bioavailable, potent, and selective protein-protein interaction inhibitor of the binding between menin and KMT2A. In KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r) and NPM1-mutant (NPM1c) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, JNJ-75276617 inhibited the association of the menin-KMT2A complex with chromatin at target gene promoters, resulting in reduced expression of several menin-KMT2A target genes, including MEIS1 and FLT3. JNJ-75276617 displayed potent antiproliferative activity across several AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines and patient samples harboring KMT2A or NPM1 alterations in vitro. In xenograft models of AML and ALL, JNJ-75276617 reduced leukemic burden and provided a significant dose-dependent survival benefit accompanied by expression changes of menin-KMT2A target genes. JNJ-75276617 demonstrated synergistic effects with gilteritinib in vitro in AML cells harboring KMT2A-r. JNJ-75276617 further exhibited synergistic effects with venetoclax and azacitidine in AML cells bearing KMT2A-r in vitro, and significantly increased survival in mice.

A cocrystal structure of menin in complex with JNJ-75276617 indicates a unique binding mode distinct from other menin-KMT2A inhibitors, including revumenib.

38871702,Multi-target measurable residual disease assessed by error-corrected sequencing in patients with acute myeloid leukemia: An ALFA study.,"Hirsch Pierre, Lambert Jérôme, Bucci Maxime, Deswarte Caroline, Boudry Augustin, Lambert Juliette, Fenwarth Laurene, Micol Jean-Baptiste, Terré Christine, Celli-Lebras Karine, Thomas Xavier, Dombret Hervé, Duployez Nicolas, Preudhomme Claude, Itzykson Raphael, Delhommeau Francois",Blood cancer journal,"{'Year': '2024', 'Month': 'Jun', 'Day': '13'}","The evaluation of measurable residual disease (MRD) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using comprehensive mutation analysis by next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been investigated in several studies. However controversial results exist regarding the detection of persisting mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 (DTA). Benchmarking of NGS-MRD taking into account other molecular MRD strategies has to be done. Here, we performed error-corrected-NGS-MRD in 189 patients homogeneously treated in the ALFA-0702 study (NCT00932412). Persistence of non-DTA mutations (HR = 2.23 for RFS and 2.26 for OS), and DTA mutations (HR = 2.16 for OS) were associated with poorer prognosis in multivariate analysis. Persistence of at least two mutations in complete remission (CR) was associated with a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (HR = 3.71, p < 0.0001), lower RFS (HR = 3.36, p < 0.0001) and OS (HR = 3.81, p = 0.00023) whereas persistence of only one mutation was not. In 100 analyzable patients, WT1-MRD, but not NGS-MRD, was an independent factor for RFS and OS. In the subset of 67 NPM1 mutated patients, both NPM1 mutation detection (p = 0.0059) and NGS-MRD (p = 0.035) status were associated with CIR. We conclude that detectable NGS-MRD including DTA mutations correlates with unfavorable prognosis in AML. Its integration with alternative MRD strategies in AML management warrants further investigations.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans, Neoplasm, Residual, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Female, Male, Middle Aged, Nucleophosmin, Adult, Aged, Mutation, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Young Adult, Prognosis, DNA Methyltransferase 3A, Aged, 80 and over, DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases, Adolescent, Repressor Proteins, DNA Mutational Analysis",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT00932412']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT00932412,The CLARA Study From the Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA 0702 Trial),A Randomized Phase II Study of Clofarabine / Intermediate-Dose Cytarabine (CLARA)Versus High-Dose Cytarabine (HDAC) as Consolidation in Younger Patients With Newly-Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).,"This study is a phase II randomized multicenter study.

We evaluated the anti-leukemia efficacy of the novel multi-kinase inhibitor CG-806, which targets FLT3 and other kinases, to circumvent drug resistance and target <i>FLT3</i> wild-type (WT) cells. The anti-leukemia activity of CG-806 was investigated by measuring apoptosis induction and analyzing the cell cycle using flow cytometry <i>in vitro</i>. CG-806 demonstrated superior anti-leukemia efficacy compared to commercially available FLT3 inhibitors, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, regardless of <i>FLT3</i> mutational status. The mechanism of action of CG-806 may involve its broad inhibitory profile against FLT3, BTK, and AuroK. In <i>FLT3</i> mutant cells, CG-806 induced G1 phase blockage, whereas in <i>FLT3</i> WT cells, it resulted in G2/M phase arrest. Targeting FLT3 and Bcl-2 and/or Mcl-1 simultaneously results in a synergistic pro-apoptotic effect in <i>FLT3</i> mutant leukemia cells.

HRQoL was a secondary end point, and it was assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) in conjunction with its elderly module (EORTC QLQ-ELD14). The following scales were a priori selected for defining the primary end point: physical and role functioning, fatigue, pain, and burden of illness. HRQoL was assessed at baseline, at regeneration from cycle 2, and at 6 and 12 months after randomization, and also before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and 100 days after transplantation. Overall, 606 patients underwent randomization. At 2 months, the risk of HRQoL deterioration was lower in the DEC arm than in the 3+7 arm; 76% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69-82) vs 88% (95% CI, 82-93); odds ratio, 0.43 (95% CI, 0.24-0.76; P = .003). No statistically significant HRQoL differences were observed between treatment arms at the long-term evaluation combining assessments at 6 and 12 months.

This multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03719534) aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of haplo-cord HCT in AML patients. A total of 268 eligible patients aged 18-60 years, diagnosed with measurable residual disease in AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia), with available haploidentical donors and suitable for allotransplantation, were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive haplo-cord HCT (n = 134) or haplo-HCT (n = 134). The 3-year overall survival (OS) was the primary endpoint in this study. Overall median follow-up was 36.50 months (IQR 24.75-46.50). The 3-year OS of Haplo-cord HCT group was better than haplo-HCT group (80.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 73.7-87.9 vs. 67.8% 95% CI 60.0-76.5, p = 0.013). Favorable progression-free survival (70.3%, 95% CI 62.6-78.8 vs. 57.6%, 95% CI 49.6-67.0, p = 0.012) and cumulative incidence of relapse (12.1%, 95% CI 12.0-12.2 vs. 30.3%, 95% CI 30.1-30.4, p = 0.024) were observed in haplo-cord HCT group. Grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) within two years posttransplantation in the two groups were similar. Haplo-cord HCT patients exhibited a faster cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery (p = 0.026) and increased T-cell reconstitution in the early period posttransplantation.

Our training set included 306 adults on Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology studies with de novo CN-AML aged < 60 years who achieved a complete remission and for whom centrally reviewed cytogenetics, RNA-sequencing, and gene mutation data from diagnostic samples were available (Alliance trial A152010). To overcome deficiencies of the Cox proportional hazards model when long-term survivors are present, we developed a penalized semi-parametric mixture cure model (MCM) to predict RFS where RNA-sequencing data comprised the predictor space. To validate model performance, we employed an independent test set from the German Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cooperative Group (AMLCG) consisting of 40 de novo CN-AML patients aged < 60 years who achieved a complete remission and had RNA-sequencing of their pre-treatment sample. For the training set, there was a significant non-zero cure fraction (p = 0.019) with 28.5% of patients estimated to be cured. Our MCM included 112 genes associated with cure, or long-term RFS, and 87 genes associated with latency, or shorter-term time-to-relapse.

The disease is driven by leukemic stem cells (LSCs), which are characterized by clonal heterogeneity and resistance to conventional therapy. These cells are therefore believed to be a major cause of progression and relapse. We designed MP0533, a multispecific CD3-engaging designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) that can simultaneously bind to three antigens on AML cells (CD33, CD123, and CD70), aiming to enable avidity-driven T cell-mediated killing of AML cells coexpressing at least two of the antigens. In vitro, MP0533 induced selective T cell-mediated killing of AML cell lines, as well as patient-derived AML blasts and LSCs, expressing two or more target antigens, while sparing healthy HSCs, blood, and endothelial cells. The higher selectivity also resulted in markedly lower levels of cytokine release in normal human blood compared to single antigen-targeting T-cell engagers. In xenograft AML mice models, MP0533 induced tumor-localized T-cell activation and cytokine release, leading to complete eradication of the tumors while having no systemic adverse effects. These studies show that the multispecific-targeting strategy used with MP0533 holds promise for improved selectivity toward LSCs and efficacy against clonal heterogeneity, potentially bringing a new therapeutic option to this group of patients with a high unmet need.

We analyzed previously published AML relapse cohorts and found that 40% of relapses occur without changes in driver mutations, suggesting that non-genetic mechanisms drive relapse in a large proportion of cases. We therefore characterized epigenetic patterns of AML relapse using 26 matched diagnosis-relapse samples with ATAC-seq. This analysis identified a relapse-specific chromatin accessibility signature for mutationally stable AML, suggesting that AML undergoes epigenetic evolution at relapse independent of mutational changes. Analysis of leukemia stem cell (LSC) chromatin changes at relapse indicated that this leukemic compartment underwent significantly less epigenetic evolution than non-LSCs, while epigenetic changes in non-LSCs reflected overall evolution of the bulk leukemia. Finally, we used single-cell ATAC-seq paired with mitochondrial sequencing (mtscATAC) to map clones from diagnosis into relapse along with their epigenetic features. We found that distinct mitochondrially-defined clones exhibit more similar chromatin accessibility at relapse relative to diagnosis, demonstrating convergent epigenetic evolution in relapsed AML. These results demonstrate that epigenetic evolution is a feature of relapsed AML and that convergent epigenetic evolution can occur following treatment with induction chemotherapy.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Humans, Epigenesis, Genetic, Recurrence, Mutation, Evolution, Molecular, Chromatin, Neoplastic Stem Cells","ListElement([StringElement('acute myeloid leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cancer biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('epigenetics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('genetics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('genomics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('human', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('relapse', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE256495', 'GSE74912', 'GSE139369']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'})]",GEO,GSE256495,,,,,,,,,,

However, primary or secondary resistance to azacitidine/venetoclax is an area of unmet need and overexpression of MCL1 is suggested to be a potential resistance mechanism. Pevonedistat inhibits MCL1 through activation of NOXA, and pevonedistat/azacitidine has previously shown activity in AML. To assess the tolerability and efficacy of adding pevonedistat to azacitidine/ venetoclax in relapsed/refractory AML, we conducted a phase I, multicenter, open-label study in 16 adults with relapsed/ refractory AML. Patients were treated with azacitidine, venetoclax along with pevonedistat intravenously on days 1, 3 and 5 of each 28-day cycle at doses of 10, 15 or 20 mg/m2 in successive cohorts in the dose escalation phase. The impact of treatment on protein neddylation as well as expression of pro-apoptotic BCL2 family members was assessed. The recommended phase II dose of pevonedistat was 20 mg/m2. Grade 3 or higher adverse events included neutropenia (31%), thrombocytopenia (13%), febrile neutropenia (19%), anemia (19%), hypertension (19%) and sepsis (19%). The overall response rate was 46.7% for the whole cohort including complete remission in five of seven (71.4%) patients who had not previously been treated with the hypomethylating agent/venetoclax. No measurable residual disease was detected in 80.0% of the patients who achieved complete remission. The median time to best response was 50 (range, 23-77) days. Four patients were bridged to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The combination of azacitidine, venetoclax and pevonedistat is safe and shows encouraging preliminary activity in patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

In the setting of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), patient-drug treatment matching fails in a subset of patients harboring atypical internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the tyrosine kinase domain of the FLT3 gene. To address this unmet medical need, here we develop a systems-based strategy that integrates multiparametric analysis of crucial signaling pathways, and patient-specific genomic and transcriptomic data with a prior knowledge signaling network using a Boolean-based formalism. By this approach, we derive personalized predictive models describing the signaling landscape of AML FLT3-ITD positive cell lines and patients. These models enable us to derive mechanistic insight into drug resistance mechanisms and suggest novel opportunities for combinatorial treatments. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that the JNK kinase pathway plays a crucial role in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor response of FLT3-ITD cells through cell cycle regulation.

Studies on the incidence and clinical features of DS are limited in this setting, and diagnosis is challenging because of nonspecific symptoms. This study assessed the incidence, diagnostic criteria, risk factors, and correlation with clinical response of DS based on the pooled analysis of 4 clinical trials in patients with IDH2-mutated AML treated with enasidenib as monotherapy, or in combination with azacitidine or with chemotherapy. Across the total AML population, 67 of 643 (10.4%) had ≥1 any-grade DS event, with highest incidence in patients who received enasidenib plus azacitidine and lowest incidence in patients who received enasidenib plus chemotherapy (13/74 [17.6%] and 2/93 [2.2%]). The most common symptoms of DS were dyspnea/hypoxia (80.6%) and pulmonary infiltrate (73.1%). Median time to onset of first DS event across all studies was 32 days (range, 4-129). Most patients (88.1%) received systemic steroids for treatment of DS. Evaluation of baseline risk factors for DS identified higher levels of bone marrow blasts and lactate dehydrogenase as independent factors associated with increased grade 3 to 5 DS risk. Overall, these results suggest that DS associated with IDH inhibition is manageable, given the benefits of enasidenib treatment in IDH2-mutated AML. We further characterized enasidenib-related DS in these patients and identified risk factors, which could be used for DS management in clinical practice.

The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of 30 items that address general physical symptoms, physical functioning, fatigue and malaise, and social and emotional functioning. Subscale scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, with higher scores on functional scales indicating better function and higher scores on symptom scales indicating worse symptoms. A change of at least 10 points on the standardized domain scores was required for it to be considered meaningful. Results obtained just prior to the start of study treatment on Day 1 of Cycle 1 will serve as the baseline values. If not available, the most recent screening results prior to the start of study treatment on Day 1 of Cycle 1 will be considered the baseline values.

*Time Frame:* From baseline to cycle 2 day 1 (up to approximately 1 month)

**Change From Baseline in EQ-5D-5L Health Utility Index**

The European Quality of Life 5D-5L Scale (EQ-5D-5L) assesses general health-related quality of life. Health is defined in 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. Responses are coded so that a '1' indicates no problem, and '5' indicates the most serious problem. The responses for the 5 dimensions are combined in a 5-digit number. These health states are converted to a single index value using the crosswalk method to the EQ-5D-3L value set from the United Kingdom (UK). The EQ-5D-3L health utility index based on the UK population weights range from -0.594 to 1.0 with higher scores indicating higher health utility. Baseline results are obtained just prior to the start of study treatment on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and will serve as the baseline values.

FF-10101 is a novel compound that covalently binds to a cysteine residue near the active site of FLT3, irreversibly inhibiting receptor signaling. It is effective against most FLT3 activating mutations, and, unlike other inhibitors, is minimally vulnerable to resistance induced by FLT3 ligand. We conducted a phase 1 dose escalation study of oral FF-10101 in patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML, the majority of whom harbored FLT3-activating mutations and/or had prior exposure to FLT3 inhibitors. Fifty-four participants enrolled in cohorts receiving doses ranging from 10 to 225 mg per day and 50 to 100 mg twice daily (BID). The dose limiting toxicities were diarrhea and QT prolongation. Among 40 response-evaluable participants, the composite complete response rate was 10%, and the overall response rate (including partial responses) was 12.5%, including patients who had progressed on gilteritinib. Overall, 56% of participants had prior exposure to FLT3 inhibitors. The recommended phase 2 dose was 75 mg BID. FF-10101 potentially represents a next-generation advance in the management of FLT3-mutated AML.

We built group-based trajectory models (GBTM) to find trajectories of change in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Physical Well-Being (FACT-PWB) subscale (up to 5 time points over 0 to 200 days of follow-up) using data from adults with newly diagnosed AML in 4 supportive care studies. We also estimated the association of baseline characteristics (age, marital status, education, AML risk, baseline FACT-PWB, depression, and anxiety) with group membership. Among 343 patients with ≥2 FACT-PWB scores, mean age was 69.6 years (standard deviation, 12.1); most had intermediate-risk AML (n = 178 [51.8%]), received intensive treatment (n = 244 [71.1%]), and died during follow-up (n = 199 [58.0%]). The GBTM with 4 distinct trajectories showed the best fit.

The allogeneic T-cell antileukemic activity via donor lymphocyte infusions and stem cell transplantation suggests a potential role for checkpoint blockade therapy in AML. While clinical trials employing these treatments have fallen short of expected results, a deeper exploration into the functional states of T cells in AML could bridge this knowledge gap. In this study, we analyzed the polyfunctional activity of T cells in a cohort of patients with relapsed/refractory (RelRef) AML treated on the clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02397720) of combination therapy using azacitidine and nivolumab (Aza/Nivo). We utilized the single-cell polyfunctional multiplexed immune assay IsoPlexis to evaluate the CD4 and CD8 T cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples collected before and after immunotherapy. This revealed at a pseudobulk level that the CD4 T cells exhibited higher functional activity post-immunotherapy (post-IO), suggesting that CD4-directed therapies may play a role in RelRef AML. Additional single-cell analysis revealed significant differences in baseline polyfunctionality in bone marrows of responders as compared with nonresponders for both CD4 and CD8 T cells.

We identified 464 patients with FLT3-ITD mutations treated on Children's Oncology Group trials with available sequencing and outcome data. Overall survival, event-free survival (EFS), and relapse risk were determined according to the presence of cooccurring risk stratifying mutations. Among the cohort, 79% of patients had cooccurring alterations across 239 different genes that were altered through mutations or fusions. Evaluation of the prognostic impact of the cooccurring mutations demonstrated that patients with ITDpos AML experienced significantly different outcomes according to the cooccurring mutational profile. Patients with ITDpos AML harboring a cooccurring favorable-risk mutation of NPM1, CEBPA, t(8;21), or inv(16) experienced a 5-year EFS of 64%, which was significantly superior to of 22.2% for patients with ITDpos AML and poor-risk mutations of WT1, UBTF, or NUP98::NSD1 as well to 40.9% for those who lacked either favorable-risk or poor-risk mutation (ITDpos intermediate; P < .001 for both). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that cooccurring mutations had significant prognostic impact, whereas allelic ratio had no impact. Therapy intensification, specifically consolidation transplant in remission, resulted in significant improvements in survival for ITDpos AML. However, patients with ITDpos/NUP98::NSD1 continued to have poor outcomes with intensified therapy, including sorafenib. Cooccurring mutational profile in ITDpos AML has significant prognostic impacts and is critical to determining risk stratification and therapeutic allocation.

Treatment administration

Induction therapy Eligible patients will be treated with induction therapy (decitabine + cytarabine) at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Center inpatient leukemia service at Shadyside Hospital. Patients will receive decitabine 20mg/m2 in 100mL normal saline (NS) intravenously (IV) over 1 hour daily for five days, followed by cytarabine 100mg/m2 in 1000 mL normal saline (NS) as a continuous IV infusion over 24 hours for 5 days. Treatment should be discontinued or delayed for any of the following during the treatment period: a rise in serum creatinine \> 2x patient baseline or upper limit of normal (whichever is higher) unless there is an identifiable reversible etiology, or ALT, AST or total bilirubin \> 5x upper limit of normal, and should be held until resolution below these parameters. There are no parameters for dose reduction.

Patients who have persistent disease on post-treatment bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, will undergo a repeat cycle of induction with decitabine followed by cytarabine as outlined above.

Supportive care including blood product transfusions, antiemetic medications antiviral and antifungal medications, or empiric antibiotics may be used at the clinical discretion of the provider.

Maintenance therapy Patients in complete response (CR) will proceed to decitabine maintenance therapy, where each treatment will be decitabine 20mg/m2 in 100mL normal saline (NS) intravenously (IV) over 1 hour daily for five days administered in the outpatient setting. Maintenance treatments will be continued until disease relapse. Maintenance treatments can be administered as an outpatient at the Hillman Cancer Center, or at a University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) facility that is able to administer chemotherapy under the supervision of an Oncologist

Evaluations during maintenance Phase:

During maintenance therapy, complete blood count (CBC) w/ diff/platelets, CMP (Na, K, Cl, carbon dioxide (CO2), glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), Cr, Ca, Total Protein, Albumin, AST, ALT, Alk Phos, Total Bilirubin) will be checked each cycle on day 14 \[+/- 4 days\].

Within 7 days of start of new cycle, study visits will include physical exam, adverse events assessment, CBC and comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP).

Maintenance cycles will be 28 days \[+/- 7 days\]. Cycles can be held up to 4 weeks \[28 days\]. For start of new cycle, any grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic toxicity possibly, probably or definitely related to decitabine therapy must resolve to grade 2 or baseline.

In addition the following lab parameters must be met to start a new cycle of maintenance:

Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \> or = 1000/mm3 Platelets \>/= 50,000/mm3 AST or ALT \< 2 x Uppler Limit of Normal (ULN) Total billirubin \< 2 x ULN Serum creatinine \< 2x patient baseline or upper limit of normal (whichever is higher)

\[If lab parameters are not met for start of cycle, these labs will be checked a minimum of once per week\]. If start of new cycle is held for more than 4 weeks \[28 days\], the subject will be off treatment.

The FACT-Leu Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Measure is a 27-item FACT-G scale plus a 17-item leukemia sub-scale. The FACT-G contains uses Likert scale 0-4, with 0 =""not at all"" and 4 =""very much"". The total score can be 0-108 and includes 7 items related Physical Well-being (PWB), 7 items related to Social Well-being (SWB), 6 items related to Emotional Well-being (EWB) and 7 items related to Functional Well-Being (FWB). Higher scores are better. Responses based on how patients felt in the past 7 days. FACT-Leu uses a Likert scale (0 to 4, with 0= ""not at all"" and 4= ""very much""). The total score for the 17 items can be 0-68. Higher scores are better. The FACT-Leu total is the sum of FACT-G and FACT Leu and ranges from 0-176. Higher scores are better. FACT Trial Outcome Index is derived by adding scores on the PWB and FWB sub-scales to the leukemia sub-scales. The total for this index score is from 0-124. Higher scores are better.

Serious illness conversations (SICs) may increase disease understanding and preparations for the future. However, SICs often happen late, in part because of clinician-perceived patient discomfort. Telehealth may promote patient comfort by allowing SICs to take place at home. This study assesses the feasibility and usability of a telehealth-delivered Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) for older adults with AML and MDS. We conducted a single-arm pilot study including 20 older adults with AML and MDS. Feasibility was measured using retention rate, with >80% considered feasible. Usability was measured using telehealth usability questionnaire (TUQ; range, 1-7): >5 considered usable.

Hypothesis testing was performed at α = 0.10 owing to the pilot nature and small sample size. Retention rate was 95% (19/20); mean TUQ scores were 5.9 (standard deviation [SD], 0.9) and 5.9 (SD, 1.1) for patients and caregivers, respectively. We found the SICP to be acceptable. The majority of patients found the SICP to be very or extremely worthwhile (88.2%; 15/17), and reported it increased closeness with their clinician (75.0%; 12/16). After their visit, patient estimates of curability, and overall life expectancy aligned more closely with those of their clinicians. In qualitative interviews, most patients said that they would recommend this program to others (89.5%, 17/19). This study demonstrated that delivery of the telehealth SICP to older patients with AML and MDS is feasible, usable, and acceptable.

Tagraxofusp (TAG), recombinant interleukin-3 fused to a truncated diphtheria toxin payload, is a first-in-class drug targeting CD123 approved for treatment of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. We previously found that AMLs with acquired resistance to TAG were re-sensitized by the DNA hypomethylating agent azacitidine (AZA) and that TAG-exposed cells became more dependent on the antiapoptotic molecule BCL-2. Here, we report a phase 1b study in 56 adults with CD123-positive AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), first combining TAG with AZA in AML/MDS, and subsequently TAG, AZA, and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN) in AML. Adverse events with 3-day TAG dosing were as expected, without indication of increased toxicity of TAG or AZA+/-VEN in combination. The recommended phase 2 dose of TAG was 12 μg/kg/day for 3 days, with 7-day AZA +/- 21-day VEN. In an expansion cohort of 26 patients (median age 71) with previously untreated European LeukemiaNet adverse-risk AML (50% TP53 mutated), triplet TAG-AZA-VEN induced response in 69% (n=18/26; 39% complete remission [CR], 19% complete remission with incomplete count recovery [CRi], 12% morphologic leukemia-free state [MLFS]). Among 13 patients with TP53 mutations, 7/13 (54%) achieved CR/CRi/MLFS (CR = 4, CRi = 2, MLFS = 1). Twelve of 17 (71%) tested responders had no flow measurable residual disease. Median overall survival and progression-free survival were 14 months (95% CI, 9.5-NA) and 8.5 months (95% CI, 5.1-NA), respectively. In summary, TAG-AZA-VEN shows encouraging safety and activity in high-risk AML, including TP53-mutated disease, supporting further clinical development of TAG combinations.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can contribute to MDS progression and mediate resistance to anti-PD1 therapy. As histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) decrease MDSCs in preclinical models, we conducted an investigator-initiated, NCI-Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program-sponsored, multicenter, dose escalation, and expansion phase Ib trial (NCT02936752) of the HDACi entinostat and the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab. Twenty-eight patients (25 MDS and 3 AML) were enrolled. During dose escalation (n=13 patients), there was one dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) on dose level (DL) 1 (G5 pneumonia/bronchoalveolar hemorrhage) and two DLTs at DL 2 (G3 pharyngeal mucositis and G3 anorexia). Per the 3 + 3 dose escalation design, DL 1 (entinostat 8 mg PO days 1 and 15 + pembrolizumab 200 mg IV day 1 every 21 days) was expanded and another 15 patients were enrolled. Hematologic adverse events (AEs) were common. The most common non-hematologic ≥G3 AEs were infection (32%), hypoxia/respiratory failure (11%), and dyspnea (11%). There were no protocol-defined responses among the 28 patients enrolled. Two patients achieved a marrow complete remission (mCR). Using a systems immunology approach with mass cytometry and machine learning analysis, mCR patients had increased classical monocytes and macrophages but there was no significant change of MDSCs. In conclusion, combining entinostat with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced MDS and AML was associated with limited clinical efficacy and substantial toxicity. Absence of an effect on MDSCs could be a potential explanation for the limited efficacy of this combination.

We recently launched a longitudinal natural history study for patients with FPDMM. Among 27 families with research genomic data by the end of 2021, 26 different germline RUNX1 variants were detected. Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively. In 25 of 51 (49%) patients without hematologic malignancy, somatic mutations were detected in at least 1 of the clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) genes or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driver genes. BCOR was the most frequently mutated gene (in 9 patients), and multiple BCOR mutations were identified in 4 patients. Mutations in 6 other CHIP- or AML-driver genes (TET2, DNMT3A, KRAS, LRP1B, IDH1, and KMT2C) were also found in ≥2 patients without hematologic malignancy. Moreover, 3 unrelated patients (1 with myeloid malignancy) carried somatic mutations in NFE2, which regulates erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. Sequential sequencing data from 19 patients demonstrated dynamic changes of somatic mutations over time, and stable clones were more frequently found in older adult patients. In summary, there are diverse types of germline RUNX1 mutations and high frequency of somatic mutations related to clonal hematopoiesis in patients with FPDMM.

Genes tell the body and its cells how to work. Familial platelet disease (FPD) or FPD with associated malignancies (FPDMM) is caused by a variant in the gene RUNX1. People with this disease may have problems with their blood and bleed for a long time when they are injured. Researchers want to learn more about RUNX1 variants and FPD.

Objective:

To learn more about FPD in people with RUNX1 variants to lead to better diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment.

Eligibility:

People any age with a suspected or confirmed RUNX1 variant

People who have a family member with the variant

Design:

All participants will be screened with a phone call and a blood, saliva, or cheek cell sample.

Participants with a suspected or confirmed variant will have 1 visit. It will last about 2 days. They will then have visits at least once a year.

Visits will include:

* Medical history and physical exam
* Blood tests or saliva sample
* Possible skin biopsy: A small piece of the participant s skin will be removed.
* Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy: The participant s bone marrow will be removed by needle from a large bone such as the hip bone.
* Possible apheresis: Blood will be removed from the body and certain blood cells will be taken out. The rest of the blood is returned to the body.

Between visits, participants with a suspected or confirmed variant will keep a diary of disease symptoms and signs.

Samples from all participants may be used for genetic testing",2019-03-28,2028-12-31,,1000,"**Natural History**

Here, using a CRISPRi screen targeting chromatin factors, we identified the nucleosome-remodeling factor (NURF) subunit BPTF as an essential regulator of AML cell survival. We demonstrate that BPTF forms an alternative NURF chromatin remodeling complex with SMARCA5 and BAP18, which regulates the accessibility of a large set of insulator regions in leukemic cells. This ensures efficient CTCF binding and boundary formation between topologically associated domains that is essential for maintaining the leukemic transcriptional programs.

Aspacytarabine, an inactive prodrug of cytarabine, was evaluated as monotherapy in a phase 2b study of patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy (NCT03435848). Sixty-five patients with AML were treated with aspacytarabine 4.5 g/m2 per day (equimolar to 3 g/m2 per day cytarabine) for 6 doses per treatment.

Pharmacological removal of the differentiation block contributes to the cure of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in the absence of cytotoxic chemotherapy, but this approach has not yet been translated to non-APL AMLs. Here, by investigating the function of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF1α and HIF2α, we found that both genes exert oncogenic functions in AML and that HIF2α is a novel regulator of the AML differentiation block. Mechanistically, we found that HIF2α promotes the expression of transcriptional repressors that have been implicated in suppressing AML myeloid differentiation programs.

The recruitment for this study is currently ongoing with the help of clinicians, nurses and data managers at the Saint-Luc clinics, University Hospital Leuven (Campus Gasthuisberg) and University Hospital Gent.

Primary Objective

•To assess the composition and activity of the gut microbiota in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) compared to matched control subjects.

Secondary Objectives

* To investigate correlations between the gut microbiota, cachectic hallmarks and gut microbiota-related markers in the blood (gut permeability markers, microbial compounds, microbial metabolites).
* To characterize the changes in the gut microbial ecosystem that are induced by chemotherapy and associated with colitis.
* To assess whether the composition of the gut microbiota can predict the severity of chemotherapy-related colitis.

Study Design

This is an academic multi-centric prospective study. The study is composed of two cohorts (Fig. 1). In Cohort A, patients are included before any chemotherapy. Biological samples (urine, feces, blood) are collected, alongside information on nutritional habits, appetite and medical records. Muscle strength and body composition are also measured. Only patients receiving a standard chemotherapy are included in Cohort B. In Cohort B, biological samples are collected and body composition, muscle strength and appetite are evaluated at 2 different time points, at the end of the chemotherapy (T1) and at discharge (T4).",2015-12-04,2020-01-11,NA,60,"**Description of gut microbiota composition in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and control subjects**

Genes tell the body and its cells how to work. Familial platelet disease (FPD) or FPD with associated malignancies (FPDMM) is caused by a variant in the gene RUNX1. People with this disease may have problems with their blood and bleed for a long time when they are injured. Researchers want to learn more about RUNX1 variants and FPD.

Objective:

To learn more about FPD in people with RUNX1 variants to lead to better diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment.

Eligibility:

People any age with a suspected or confirmed RUNX1 variant

People who have a family member with the variant

Design:

All participants will be screened with a phone call and a blood, saliva, or cheek cell sample.

Participants with a suspected or confirmed variant will have 1 visit. It will last about 2 days. They will then have visits at least once a year.

Visits will include:

* Medical history and physical exam
* Blood tests or saliva sample
* Possible skin biopsy: A small piece of the participant s skin will be removed.
* Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy: The participant s bone marrow will be removed by needle from a large bone such as the hip bone.
* Possible apheresis: Blood will be removed from the body and certain blood cells will be taken out. The rest of the blood is returned to the body.

Between visits, participants with a suspected or confirmed variant will keep a diary of disease symptoms and signs.

Up to 6 cycles of cytarabine 20 mg/day s.c., bid, days 1-7 and etoposide 100 mg/day, p.o. or i.v., days 1-3 with (ATRA) or without ATRA (CONTROL) were intended. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Between May 2011 and September 2016, 144 patients (median age, 77 years; range, 64-92 years) were randomized (72, CONTROL; 72, ATRA). Baseline characteristics were balanced between the two study arms. The median number of treatment cycles was 2 in ATRA and 2.5 in CONTROL.

CD123, the cellular receptor for interleukin-3, expressed in AML is an attractive target for tumor-specific therapy. Vibecotamab (XmAb14045), a humanized bispecific antibody, monovalently binds both CD3 and CD123 to recruit cytotoxic T cells to kill CD123+ tumor cells. This phase 1 study's primary objectives were safety and tolerability and identification of a maximum tolerated dose/recommended dose for use as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory AML. Identification of a recommended phase 2 vibecotamab dose comprised 3 step-up doses (Week 1), which were noted to reduce cytokine response syndrome (CRS), followed by weekly dosing (1.7 μg/kg, Cohort -1D). In 16 of 120 patients, at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event was classified as a dose-limiting toxicity.

However, accurate quantitative detection of FLT3-ITD mutations remains challenging. To identify a novel biomarker in NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> AML patients for more accurate stratification, we analysed the differential gene expression between the NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> and NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>-</sup> groups in five public AML datasets and identified a biomarker by taking the intersection of differentially expressed genes. We validated this biomarker in bone marrow samples from NPM1<sup>+</sup> AML patients at the Peking University Institute of Haematology and analysed its prognostic significance. BCAT1 expression was higher in the NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> group than in the NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>-</sup> group in all seven cohorts. BCAT1 was able to predict the prognosis of NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> AML patients, and its predictive ability was superior to that of the FLT3-ITD allelic ratio (AR).

We included 259 patients from 21 institutions in Korea. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: RSV 10 mg/AML 5 mg, RSV 20 mg/AML 5 mg, or ATV 20 mg /AML 5 mg. The primary endpoint was the efficacy of the RSV 10.20 mg/AML 5 mg via percentage changes in LDL-C after 8 weeks of treatment, compared with the ATV 20 mg /AML 5 mg. There was a significant difference in the mean percentage change of LDL-C at 8 weeks between the RSV 10 mg/AML 5 mg and the ATV 20 mg/AML 5 mg (full analysis set [FAS]: -7.08%, 95% CI: -11.79 to -2.38, p = .0034, per-protocol analysis set [PPS]: -6.97%, 95% CI: -11.76 to -2.19, p = .0046).

Accurate pathologic diagnoses present challenges because of interobserver variability in interpreting morphology and quantifying dysplasia. We compared local clinical site diagnoses with central, adjudicated review from 918 participants enrolled in the ongoing National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute National MDS Natural History Study, a prospective observational cohort study of participants with suspected MDS or MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). Locally, 264 (29%) were diagnosed as having MDS, 15 (2%) MDS/MPN overlap, 62 (7%) idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS), 0 (0%) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with <30% blasts, and 577 (63%) as other. Approximately one-third of cases were reclassified after central review, with 266 (29%) diagnosed as MDS, 45 (5%) MDS/MPN overlap, 49 (5%) ICUS, 15 (2%) AML with <30%, and 543 (59%) as other. Site miscoding errors accounted for more than half (53%) of the local misdiagnoses, leaving a true misdiagnosis rate of 15% overall, 21% for MDS. Therapies were reported in 37% of patients, including 43% of patients with MDS, 49% of patients with MDS/MPN, and 86% of patients with AML with <30% blasts. Treatment rates were lower (25%) in cases with true discordance in diagnosis compared with those for whom local and central diagnoses agreed (40%), and receipt of inappropriate therapy occurred in 7% of misdiagnosed cases. Discordant diagnoses were frequent, which has implications for the accuracy of study-related and national registries and can lead to inappropriate therapy.

Despite the correlation with clinical outcomes, MRD assessment has yet to be standardized or routinely incorporated into clinical trials and discrepancies have been observed between different techniques for MRD assessment. In 62 patients with AML, aged 18-60 years, in first complete remission after intensive induction therapy on the randomized phase III SWOG-S0106 clinical trial (clinicaltrials gov. Identifier: NCT00085709), MRD detection by centralized, high-quality multiparametric flow cytometry was compared with a 29-gene panel utilizing duplex sequencing (DS), an ultrasensitive next-generation sequencing method that generates double-stranded consensus sequences to reduce false positive errors. MRD as defined by DS was observed in 22 (35%) patients and was strongly associated with higher rates of relapse (68% vs. 13%; hazard ratio [HR] =8.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.2-24.5; P<0.001) and decreased survival (32% vs. 82%; HR=5.6; 95% CI: 2.3-13.8; P<0.001) at 5 years. DS MRD strongly outperformed multiparametric flow cytometry MRD, which was observed in ten (16%) patients and marginally associated with higher rates of relapse (50% vs. 30%; HR=2.4; 95% CI: 0.9-6.7; P=0.087) and decreased survival (40% vs. 68%; HR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.0-6.3; P=0.059) at 5 years. Furthermore, the prognostic significance of DS MRD status at the time of remission for subsequent relapse was similar on both randomized arms of the trial.

We retrospectively analysed 38 adult patients with AMKL (median age: 58 years, range: 21-80). Most received intensive treatment in AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG) trials between 2001 and 2016. Cytogenetic data showed an accumulation of adverse risk markers according to ELN 2017 and an unexpected high frequency of structural aberrations on chromosome arm 1q (33%). Most frequently, mutations occurred in TET2 (23%), TP53 (23%), JAK2 (19%), PTPN11 (19%) and RUNX1 (15%). Complete remission rate in 33 patients receiving intensive chemotherapy was 33% and median overall survival (OS) was 33 weeks (95% CI: 21-45).

MDM2 inhibitor (MDM2i) monotherapy in AML has shown modest responses in clinical trials but combining options of MDM2i with other potent AML-directed agents like cytarabine and venetoclax could improve its efficacy. We conducted a phase I clinical trial (NCT03634228) to study the safety and efficacy of milademetan (an MDM2i) with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC)±venetoclax in adult patients with relapsed refractory (R/R) or newly diagnosed (ND; unfit) TP53 wild-type AML and performed comprehensive CyTOF analyses to interrogate multiple signaling pathways, the p53-MDM2 axis and the interplay between pro/anti-apoptotic molecules to identify factors that determine response and resistance to therapy. Sixteen patients (14 R/R, 2 N/D treated secondary AML) at a median age of 70 years (range, 23-80 years) were treated in this trial. Two patients (13%) achieved an overall response (complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery). Median cycles on trial were 1 (range 1-7) and at a median follow-up of 11 months, no patients remained on active therapy. Gastrointestinal toxicity was significant and dose-limiting (50% of patients ≥ grade 3). Single-cell proteomic analysis of the leukemia compartment revealed therapy-induced proteomic alterations and potential mechanisms of adaptive response to the MDM2i combination. The response was associated with immune cell abundance and induced the proteomic profiles of leukemia cells to disrupt survival pathways and significantly reduced MCL1 and YTHDF2 to potentiate leukemic cell death. The combination of milademetan, LDAC±venetoclax led to only modest responses with recognizable gastrointestinal toxicity. Treatment-induced reduction of MCL1 and YTHDF2 in an immune-rich milieu correlate with treatment response.","Clinical Trial, Phase I, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult, Humans, Young Adult, Middle Aged, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cytarabine, Tumor Suppressor Protein p53, Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein, Proteomics, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT03634228']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase I', attributes={'UI': 'D017426'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT03634228,Milademetan Tosylate and Low-Dose Cytarabine With or Without Venetoclax in Treating Participants With Recurrent or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia,A Phase I/II Study of the Oral MDM2 Inhibitor DS-3032b (Milademetan) in Combination With Low Dose Cytarabine (LDAC) in Patients With Newly Diagnosed or Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML),"This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of milademetan tosylate and to see how well it works with cytarabine with or without ventoclax in treating participants with acute myeloid leukemia that has come back (recurrent) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory).

However, some patients are ineligible because of psychosocial barriers, such as lack of appropriate caregiver support. We hypothesized that immune checkpoint inhibition after autologous transplant might represent effective postremission therapy in such patients. We conducted a phase 2 study of autologous transplantation followed by administration of pembrolizumab (8 cycles starting day +1). Twenty patients with nonfavorable AML in complete remission were treated (median age, 64 years; CR1, 80%); 55% were non-White and adverse-risk AML was present in 40%. Treatment was well tolerated, with only 1 nonrelapse death. Immune-related adverse events occurred in 9 patients. After a median follow-up of 80 months, 14 patients remain alive, with 10 patients in continuous remission. The estimated 2-year LFS was 48.4%, which met the primary end point of 2-year LFS >25%; the 2-year overall survival (OS), nonrelapse mortality, and cumulative incidences of relapse were 68%, 5%, and 46%, respectively.

Monoclonal antibodies, such as gemtuzumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving combination chemotherapy together with gemtuzumab may kill more cancer cells.

Based on its immunomodulatory and anti-leukemic properties we considered Lenalidomide (Lena) to act synergistically with Aza/DLI to improve outcome. We, therefore, prospectively investigated tolerability and efficacy of this combination as first salvage therapy for adults with post-transplant relapse of acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Patients were scheduled for eight cycles Aza (75 mg/m2 day 1-7), Lena (2.5 or 5 mg, days 1-21) and up to three DLI with increasing T-cell dosages (0.5×106-1.5×107 cells/kg). Primary endpoint was safety, while secondary endpoints included response, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and overall survival (OS). Fifty patients with molecular (52%) or hematological (48%) relapse of myelodysplastic syndromes (n=24), acute myeloid leukemia (n=23) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=3) received a median of seven (range, 1-8) cycles including 14 patients with 2.5 mg and 36 with 5 mg Lena daily dosage. Concomitantly, 34 patients (68%) received at least one DLI. Overall response rate was 56% and 25 patients (50%) achieved complete remission being durable in 80%. Median OS was 21 months and 1-year OS rate 65% with no impact of type of or time to relapse and Lena dosages. Treatment was well tolerated indicated by febrile neutropenia being the only grade ≥3 non-hematologic adverse event in >10% of patients and modest acute (grade 2-4 24%) and chronic (moderate/severe 28%) GvHD incidences. In summary, Lena can be safely added to Aza/DLI without excess of GvHD and toxicity. Its significant anti-leukemic activity suggests that this combination is a novel salvage option for post-transplant relapse (clinicaltrials gov.

The entire FACT-Th-18 was used in this trial, which includes the 18-item thrombocytopenia subscale used to assess the impact of symptoms, signs, and functional consequences of thrombocytopenia in MDS and AML subjects. The FACT-Th-18 is a validated and reliable instrument with known psychometric properties. FACT-ThS is an 18 item questionnaire specific to assessing the impact of symptoms, signs, and functional consequences of Thrombocytopenia. ThS score ranges from 0 to 72 with higher the score, the better the QoL. FACT G total score moves from 0 to 108 where higher the score, the better the HRQL.

FACT-Th Total Score is calculated by adding the FACT-ThS and FACT-G score. Total score ranges from 0 to 180 and again, higher the score, the better the HRQL.

**EQ-5D Utility Score Analysis**

EuroQoL Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) is a standardized generic preference based health related quality of life instrument. It records how one's health is ""today"" and consists of a descriptive system. The Descriptive system is Comprised of 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression. Each dimension on the EQ-5D involves a 3-point response scale which indicates the level of impairment (level 1 = no problem; level 2 = some or moderate problem(s) and level 3 = unable, or extreme problems). Level of problem reported in each EQ-5D dimension determines a unique health state which is converted into a weighted health state index by applying scores from EQ-5D preference weights elicited from general population samples. This generates a unique description of the subjects' health status, which is valued between 0 (representing death) and 1 (representing perfect health). Higher the score, the better the quality of life.

EQ-ED is a score.

Many maternal complications, such as eclampsia and cerebrovascular accidents, occur in the postpartum period. Despite widespread use of antihypertensives during pregnancy and childbirth, there is a paucity of data on preferred medications in the postpartum period. This randomized controlled study enrolled 130 women who were started on antihypertensives. They were randomized to receive oral Labetalol(LAB, maximum 900 mg per day in three doses) or oral Amlodipine(AML, maximum 10 mg per day given in two doses). In the immediate postpartum, all women were closely monitored for neurological symptoms, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, urine output, and deep tendon reflex. The primary outcome was the time to achieve sustained blood pressure control for 12 h from the initiation of medication; secondary outcomes included side effects of both medications. Mean time to achieve sustained blood pressure control was lower in women who received AML than in those who received LAB-(mean difference 7.2 h; 38 95% CI 1.4, 12.9, p = 0.011). There were fewer severe hypertensive episodes among those with AML than in those who received LAB. However, the proportion of women who continued to require antihypertensives at discharge was higher in the AML group than in the LAB group (55.4% versus 32.3%, p = 0.008). None of the participants developed drug-related side effects. Among women with postpartum persistence or new-onset hypertension, oral AML achieved sustained blood pressure control in a shorter duration, with fewer hypertensive emergencies than oral LAB.

Stem cell transplant can cure children where chemotherapy and other drugs have failed. In this case, the immune cells of the donor attack the leukaemia cells of the patient. Cord blood collected from the placenta of unrelated babies is often used as a donor cell source and appears to work well at controlling leukaemia and less likely to cause complications such as when the immune cells also mistakenly attack healthy tissues (called graft versus host disease, GVHD).

The investigators have noticed that during cord blood transplant, the donor immune system appears to recover more quickly and not be associated with GVHD, when a type of blood transfusion containing white cells are also given to the patient. The infused white cells appear to stimulate the donor immune cells to expand much more than usually seen.

During this research, the investigators will study this immune cell expansion during cord blood transplant in children with difficult-to-cure leukaemia who also receive a transfusion of white cells, termed granulocytes.

We analyzed the impact of midostaurin in 227 FLT3mut-AML patients included in the AML-12 prospective trial for fit patients ≤70 years (#NCT04687098). Patients were divided into an early (2012-2015) and late (2016-2020) cohorts. They were uniformly treated except for the addition of midostaurin in 71% of late group patients. No differences were observed in response rates or the number of allotransplants between groups. Outcome was improved in the late period: 2-year relapse incidence decreased from 42% vs 29% in early vs late group (p = 0.024) and 2-year overall survival (OS) improved from 47% vs 61% (p = 0.042), respectively. The effect of midostaurin was evident in NPM1mut patients (n = 151), with 2-yr OS of 72% (exposed) vs 50% (naive) patients (p = 0.011) and mitigated FLT3-ITD allelic ratio prognostic value: 2-yr OS with midostaurin was 85% and 58% in low and high ratio patients (p = 0.049) vs 67% and 39% in naive patients (p = 0.005).

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored MDS Natural History Study is a prospective cohort enrolling patients undergoing workup for suspected MDS in the setting of cytopenias. Untreated patients undergo bone marrow assessment with central histopathology review for assignment as MDS, MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with <30% blasts, or ""At-Risk."" HRQoL data are collected at enrollment, including the MDS-specific Quality of Life in Myelodysplasia Scale (QUALMS). Vulnerability is assessed with the Vulnerable Elders Survey. Baseline HRQoL scores from 449 patients with MDS, MDS/MPN, AML <30%, ICUS or At-Risk were similar among diagnoses. In MDS, HRQoL was worse for vulnerable participants (eg, mean Patent-Reported Outcomes Management Information Systems [PROMIS] Fatigue of 56.0 vs 49.5; P < .001) and those with worse prognosis (eg, mean Euroqol-5 Dimension-5 Level [EQ-5D-5L] of 73.4, 72.7, and 64.1 for low, intermediate, and high-risk disease; P = .005). Among vulnerable MDS participants, most had difficulty with prolonged physical activity (88%), such as walking a quarter mile (74%). These data suggest that cytopenias leading to MDS evaluation are associated with similar HRQoL, regardless of eventual diagnosis, but with worse HRQoL among the vulnerable. Among those with MDS, lower-risk disease was associated with better HRQoL, but the relationship was lost among the vulnerable, showing for the first time that vulnerability trumps disease risk in affecting HRQoL.

These recommendations allow to transfuse a single RBP for very elderly patients or in cases of associated heart disease (heart failure). A recent development (2012) on post-transfusion pulmonary edema overload recommends transfusion unit by unit for high risk patients.

More recently, a Swiss team has historically compared transfusion policies in 2 139 patients with hematological malignancies. The first group received 2 RBP transfusion in case of symptomatic anemia or hemoglobin level \<6 g / dL. The other group only received 1 RBP at each transfusion. In total 2212 units in 1548 transfusions were performed and the 1 RBP transfusion policy has resulted in a 25% decrease in the number of RBP used without any complication. In a prospective single-center pilot study, we showed that transfusing a single RBP was possible without increasing the side effects of anemia, without complications and allow an overall reduction in consumption of red blood cell units.

Several meta-analyzes reported in intensive care or bleeding situations that a restrictive use of transfusions significantly reduces cardiac events, bleeding, bacterial infections and mortality. The number of patient to be treated to prevent one death is 33.

The main objective is to demonstrate in a randomized trial that the restrictive strategy (transfusion of a single unit at each transfusion) is not inferior to the liberal strategy (transfusion of 2 unit at each transfusion) in terms of severe complication. Transfusion are performed in case of hemoglobin level \<8g/dL.

Key secondary objectives are to reduce the number of RBP used and the cost of hospitalization with a comparison of complications/mortality in the 2 groups.",2016-01,2019-06,PHASE3,230,"**Number of severe complications (grade 3 or more)**

**Change From Baseline in Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)**

The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a screening tool designed to assess the severity and impact of fatigue on daily functioning of participants with cancer during the 24 hours. There are 9 items on the scale. The first three questions ask participants to rate their fatigues on a scale from 0 (no fatigue) - 10 (as bad as you can imagine), with higher scores indicating worse outcome. The remaining six questions ask participants to rate how much fatigue has interfered with their daily activities on a scale from 0 (Does not interfere) to 10 (Completely interferes). A global fatigue score can be obtained by averaging all the items on the BFI. The global BFI score will be calculated only if at least 5 of the 9 items are answered. A higher BFI fatigue score indicates worse outcome.

Transfusion conversion \& maintenance rate was defined for gilteritinib arm. Participants were classified as transfusion independent if there were no RBC or platelet transfusions within 28 days prior to the first dose to 28 days after the first dose; otherwise they were classified as transfusion dependent at baseline. Participants were considered independent postbaseline if they had 1 consecutive 8 week period without any RBC or platelet transfusion from 29 days after the first dose until the last dose date. For participants who were on treatment ≤ 4 weeks or \> 4 weeks but \< 12 weeks and there was no RBC or platelet transfusion within postbaseline period, they were considered not evaluable; otherwise, they were considered postbaseline transfusion dependent.

Glucuronidation is a common mechanism of drug inactivation impacting many AML therapies, e.g., cytarabine, decitabine, azacytidine and venetoclax. In AML cells, the capacity for glucuronidation arises from increased production of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) enzymes. UGT1A elevation was first observed in AML patients who relapsed after response to ribavirin, a drug used to target the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, and subsequently in patients who relapsed on cytarabine. UGT1A elevation resulted from increased expression of the sonic-hedgehog transcription factor GLI1. Vismodegib inhibited GLI1, decreased UGT1A levels, reduced glucuronidation of ribavirin and cytarabine, and re-sensitized cells to these drugs. Here, we examined if UGT1A protein levels, and thus glucuronidation activity, were targetable in humans and if this corresponded to clinical response. We conducted a phase II trial using vismodegib with ribavirin, with or without decitabine, in largely heavily pre-treated patients with high-eIF4E AML. Pre-therapy molecular assessment of patients' blasts indicated highly elevated UGT1A levels relative to healthy volunteers. Among patients with partial response, blast response or prolonged stable disease, vismodegib reduced UGT1A levels, which corresponded to effective targeting of eIF4E by ribavirin. In all, our studies are the first to demonstrate that UGT1A protein, and thus glucuronidation, are targetable in humans. These studies pave the way for the development of therapies that impair glucuronidation, one of the most common drug deactivation modalities.

The functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT-Fatigue Scale V 4.0) is a subscale of the FACIT-F and has been validated in the oncology setting. The FACIT-Fatigue Scale is a short, 13-item, self-administered tool that measures the level of fatigue in an individual during usually daily activities over the past week. The level of fatigue is measured on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not at all; 4 = very much. The scores range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating less fatigue. If there were missing items, but the participant answered at least 50% of the items, then subscores were prorated.

The interaction of menin with lysine methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A), an epigenetic regulator, is a dependence in acute leukaemia caused by either rearrangement of KMT2A or mutation of the nucleophosmin 1 gene (NPM1)<sup>4-6</sup>. KMT2A rearrangements occur in up to 10% of acute leukaemias and have an adverse prognosis, whereas NPM1 mutations occur in up to 30%, forming the most common genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukaemia<sup>7,8</sup>. Here, we describe the results of the first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial investigating revumenib (SNDX-5613), a potent and selective oral inhibitor of the menin-KMT2A interaction, in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukaemia (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04065399). We show that therapy with revumenib was associated with a low frequency of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events and a 30% rate of complete remission or complete remission with partial haematologic recovery (CR/CRh) in the efficacy analysis population. Asymptomatic prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiography was identified as the only dose-limiting toxicity. Remissions occurred in leukaemias refractory to multiple previous lines of therapy. We demonstrate clearance of residual disease using sensitive clinical assays and identify hallmarks of differentiation into normal haematopoietic cells, including differentiation syndrome.

However, the molecular mechanisms driving these alterations remain poorly defined. Using mouse models of ALL and AML, here we show that leukemic cells turn off lymphopoiesis and erythropoiesis shortly after colonizing the bone marrow. ALL and AML cells express lymphotoxin α1β2 and activate lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) signaling in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which turns off IL7 production and prevents non-malignant lymphopoiesis. We show that the DNA damage response pathway and CXCR4 signaling promote lymphotoxin α1β2 expression in leukemic cells. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of LTβR signaling in MSCs restores lymphopoiesis but not erythropoiesis, reduces leukemic cell growth, and significantly extends the survival of transplant recipients. Similarly, CXCR4 blocking also prevents leukemia-induced IL7 downregulation and inhibits leukemia growth. These studies demonstrate that acute leukemias exploit physiological mechanisms governing hematopoietic output as a strategy for gaining competitive advantage.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Animals, Mice, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Lymphotoxin beta Receptor, Interleukin-7, Lymphopoiesis, Lymphotoxin alpha1, beta2 Heterotrimer, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Tumor Microenvironment","ListElement([StringElement('CXCR4', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('immunology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('inflammation', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('interleukin-7', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('lymphotoxin beta receptor', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('mouse', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE218505']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'})]",GEO,GSE218505,,,,,,,,,,

Serial MRD assessment is now routinely recommended in the evaluation of treatment response and monitoring in AML by the European LeukemiaNet. The key question remains, however, if MRD in AML is clinically actionable or ""does MRD merely portend fate""? With a series of new drug approvals since 2017, we now have more targeted and less toxic therapeutic options for the potential application of MRD-directed therapy. Recent approval of <i>NPM1</i> MRD as a regulatory endpoint is also foreseen to drastically transform the clinical trial landscape such as biomarker-driven adaptive design. In this article, we will review (1) the emerging molecular MRD markers (such as non-<i>DTA</i> mutations, <i>IDH1/2</i>, and <i>FLT3</i>-ITD); (2) the impact of novel therapeutics on MRD endpoints; and (3) how MRD might be used as a predictive biomarker to guide therapy in AML beyond its prognostic role, which is the focus of two large collaborative trials: AMLM26 INTERCEPT (ACTRN12621000439842) and MyeloMATCH (NCT05564390).","Journal Article, Review","Humans, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Neoplasm, Residual, Nuclear Proteins, Nucleophosmin, Remission Induction, Prognosis, Biomarkers, Tumor","ListElement([StringElement('AML', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('MRD', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('NPM1', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('novel therapy', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('relapse', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT05564390']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Review', attributes={'UI': 'D016454'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT05564390,MYELOMATCH: A Screening Study to Assign People With Myeloid Cancer to a Treatment Study or Standard of Care Treatment Within myeloMATCH (MyeloMATCH Screening Trial),Master Screening and Reassessment Protocol (MSRP) for the NCI MyeloMATCH Clinical Trials,This MyeloMATCH Master Screening and Reassessment Protocol (MSRP) evaluates the use of a screening tool and specific laboratory tests to help improve participants' ability to register to clinical trials throughout the course of their myeloid cancer (acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome) treatment.

However, there is a lack of clinically relevant biomarkers that predict response to 5-AZA/VEN. Here, we integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, functional, and clinical data to identify predictors of 5-AZA/VEN response. Although cultured monocytic AML cells displayed upfront resistance, monocytic differentiation was not clinically predictive in our patient cohort. We identified leukemic stem cells (LSC) as primary targets of 5-AZA/VEN whose elimination determined the therapy outcome. LSCs of 5-AZA/VEN-refractory patients displayed perturbed apoptotic dependencies. We developed and validated a flow cytometry-based ""Mediators of apoptosis combinatorial score"" (MAC-Score) linking the ratio of protein expression of BCL2, BCL-xL, and MCL1 in LSCs. MAC scoring predicts initial response with a positive predictive value of more than 97% associated with increased event-free survival. In summary, combinatorial levels of BCL2 family members in AML-LSCs are a key denominator of response, and MAC scoring reliably predicts patient response to 5-AZA/VEN.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans, Proteomics, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic, Azacitidine, Stem Cells, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT04801797', 'NCT05177731']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT04801797,Venetoclax + Azacitidine vs. Induction Chemotherapy in AML,A Phase 2 Randomized Study Comparing Venetoclax and Azacitidine to Induction Chemotherapy for Newly Diagnosed Fit Adults With Acute Myeloid Leukemia,"This research is being done to assess the therapeutic activity of a promising combination (azacitidine and venetoclax) versus conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in induction-eligible patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

36843541,The eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E reprograms alternative splicing.,"Ghram Mehdi, Morris Gavin, Culjkovic-Kraljacic Biljana, Mars Jean-Clement, Gendron Patrick, Skrabanek Lucy, Revuelta Maria Victoria, Cerchietti Leandro, Guzman Monica L, Borden Katherine L B",The EMBO journal,"{'Year': '2023', 'Month': 'Apr', 'Day': '03'}","Aberrant splicing is typically attributed to splice-factor (SF) mutation and contributes to malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we discovered a mutation-independent means to extensively reprogram alternative splicing (AS). We showed that the dysregulated expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E elevated selective splice-factor production, thereby impacting multiple spliceosome complexes, including factors mutated in AML such as SF3B1 and U2AF1. These changes generated a splicing landscape that predominantly supported altered splice-site selection for ~800 transcripts in cell lines and ~4,600 transcripts in specimens from high-eIF4E AML patients otherwise harboring no known SF mutations. Nuclear RNA immunoprecipitations, export assays, polysome analyses, and mutational studies together revealed that eIF4E primarily increased SF production via its nuclear RNA export activity. By contrast, eIF4E dysregulation did not induce known SF mutations or alter spliceosome number. eIF4E interacted with the spliceosome and some pre-mRNAs, suggesting its direct involvement in specific splicing events. eIF4E induced simultaneous effects on numerous SF proteins, resulting in a much larger range of splicing alterations than in the case of mutation or dysregulation of individual SFs and providing a novel paradigm for splicing control and dysregulation.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans, Alternative Splicing, RNA Splicing Factors, Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E, RNA Splicing, Eukaryotic Initiation Factors, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mutation","ListElement([StringElement('acute myeloid leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('eIF4E', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('splicing', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE158728', 'GSE67040']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE158728,,,,,,,,,,

In order to define the underlying biology and clinical implications of this family of fusions, we performed comprehensive transcriptome, epigenome, and immunophenotypic profiling of 2,235 children and young adults with AML and identified 160 NUP98 rearrangements (7.2%), including 108 NUP98-NSD1 (4.8%), 32 NUP98-KDM5A (1.4%) and 20 NUP98-X cases (0.9%) with 13 different fusion partners. Fusion partners defined disease characteristics and biology; patients with NUP98-NSD1 or NUP98-KDM5A had distinct immunophenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiles. Unlike the two most prevalent NUP98 fusions, NUP98-X variants are typically not cryptic. Furthermore, NUP98-X cases are associated with WT1 mutations, and have epigenomic profiles that resemble either NUP98-NSD1 or NUP98-KDM5A. Cooperating FLT3-ITD and WT1 mutations define NUP98-NSD1, and chromosome 13 aberrations are highly enriched in NUP98-KDM5A.

Monoclonal antibodies, such as gemtuzumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving combination chemotherapy together with gemtuzumab may kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy is more effective with or without gemtuzumab in treating patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.

To assess the impact of concurrently inducing the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis-signaling pathways in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated activity of the TRAIL receptor agonistic fusion protein eftozanermin alfa (eftoza; ABBV-621) in combination with the B-cell lymphoma protein-2 selective inhibitor venetoclax in preclinical models and human patients. Simultaneously stimulating intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis-signaling pathways with venetoclax and eftoza, respectively, enhanced their activities in AML cell lines and patient-derived ex vivo/in vivo models. Eftoza activity alone or plus venetoclax required death receptor 4/5 (DR4/DR5) expression on the plasma membrane but was independent of TP53 or FLT3-ITD status. The safety/tolerability of eftoza as monotherapy and in combination with venetoclax was demonstrated in patients with relapsed/refractory AML in a phase 1 clinical trial. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 2 of 4 (50%) patients treated with eftoza monotherapy and 18 of 23 (78%) treated with eftoza plus venetoclax. An overall response rate of 30% (7/23; 4 complete responses [CRs], 2 CRs with incomplete hematologic recovery, and 1 morphologic leukemia-free state) was reported in patients who received treatment with eftoza plus venetoclax and 67% (4/6) in patients with myoblasts positive for DR4/DR5 expression; no tumor responses were observed with eftoza monotherapy. These data indicate that combination therapy with eftoza plus venetoclax to simultaneously activate the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis-signaling pathways may improve clinical benefit compared with venetoclax monotherapy in relapsed/refractory AML with an acceptable toxicity profile.

Recently, the ETCTN/CTEP 10026 study tested the combination of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine together with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab for AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) either after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or in the HSCT-naïve setting. Integrative transcriptome-based analysis of 304 961 individual marrow-infiltrating cells for 18 of 48 subjects treated on study revealed the strong association of response with a high baseline ratio of T to AML cells. Clinical responses were predominantly driven by decitabine-induced cytoreduction. Evidence of immune activation was only apparent after ipilimumab exposure, which altered CD4+ T-cell gene expression, in line with ongoing T-cell differentiation and increased frequency of marrow-infiltrating regulatory T cells. For post-HSCT samples, relapse could be attributed to insufficient clearing of malignant clones in progenitor cell populations. In contrast to AML/MDS bone marrow, the transcriptomes of leukemia cutis samples from patients with durable remission after ipilimumab monotherapy showed evidence of increased infiltration with antigen-experienced resident memory T cells and higher expression of CTLA-4 and FOXP3. Altogether, activity of combined decitabine and ipilimumab is impacted by cellular expression states within the microenvironmental niche of leukemic cells. The inadequate elimination of leukemic progenitors mandates urgent development of novel approaches for targeting these cell populations to generate long-lasting responses.

Early advance care planning may improve care at the end of life for patients with AML or MDS. The Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) is a multicomponent, communication intervention developed to improve conversations about values for patients with serious illnesses. The SICP has been shown to improve the quality and frequency of advance care planning discussions. We adapted the SICP for delivery via telehealth to older patients with AML or MDS. We conducted a single-center qualitative study of 45 participants (25 clinicians, 15 older patients with AML or MDS, and 5 caregivers). Participants, whether clinicians, patients, or caregivers, agreed that the SICP would help older patients with AML or MDS to share their personal values with their care team. Four qualitative themes emerged from our data: (1) serious illness conversations can be conducted via telehealth, (2) older patients have limited experience using technology but are willing and able to learn, (3) patients feel that serious illness conversations will help them understand their AML or MDS diagnosis and prognosis better, and (4) serious illness conversations should be common and routine, not extraordinary. The adapted SICP may provide older patients with AML or MDS an opportunity to share what matters most to them with their care team and may assist oncologists in aligning patient care with patient values.

Nevertheless, treatment failure remains a challenge, and predictive markers are needed, particularly for relapsed or refractory AML. Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing may correlate with outcomes, but its prospective predictive value remains unexplored. Here we report the results of the first stage of the prospective phase II VenEx trial evaluating the utility and predictiveness of venetoclax sensitivity testing using different cell culture conditions and cell viability assays in patients receiving venetoclax-azacitidine. Participants with de novo AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, relapsed or refractory AML, or secondary AML were included. The primary endpoint was the treatment response in participants showing ex vivo sensitivity and the key secondary endpoints were the correlation of sensitivity with responses and survival. Venetoclax sensitivity testing was successful in 38/39 participants. Experimental conditions significantly influenced the predictive accuracy. Blast-specific venetoclax sensitivity measured in conditioned medium most accurately correlated with treatment outcomes; 88% of sensitive participants achieved a treatment response. The median survival was significantly longer for participants who were ex vivo-sensitive to venetoclax (14.6 months for venetoclax-sensitive patients vs. 3.5 for venetoclax-insensitive patients, P<0.001).

Sensitivity to the RARα agonist tamibarotene was demonstrated in RARA-high but not RARA-low preclinical AML models. The combination of oral tamibarotene plus azacitidine was evaluated in a phase 2 clinical study in 51 newly diagnosed unfit patients with AML identified as RARA-positive (n = 22) or RARA-negative (n = 29) for RARA mRNA overexpression in peripheral blasts using a blood-based biomarker test.

We also showed that alternate-day administration of IMPDH inhibitors suppressed the development of MLL-AF9-driven AML in vivo without having a devastating effect on immune function. Mechanistically, IMPDH inhibition induced overactivation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-TRAF6-NF-κB signaling and upregulation of an adhesion molecule VCAM1, which contribute to the antileukemia effect of IMPDH inhibitors. Consequently, combined treatment with IMPDH inhibitors and the TLR1/2 agonist effectively inhibited the development of MLL-fusion AML. These findings provide a rational basis for clinical testing of IMPDH inhibitors against MLL-fusion AMLs and potentially other aggressive tumors with active TLR signaling.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans, Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Enzyme Inhibitors, NF-kappa B, Immunosuppressive Agents","ListElement([StringElement('IMPDH inhibitor', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('MLL-fusion leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('TLR signaling', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Vcam1', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE214474']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE214474,,,,,,,,,,

The results of the dose-finding phase 1 part have been previously published. Patients were randomized 1:1 to LDAC plus nintedanib or LDAC plus placebo stratified by AML status (newly diagnosed vs r/r). LDAC was applied subcutaneously at 20 mg twice daily on days 1 to 10. Nintedanib/placebo was orally administered twice daily on days 1 to 28 in 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Between 05/2017 and 09/2019, 31 patients were randomized and 30 were treated, before the study was terminated prematurely due to slow recruitment. Median (range) age of patients was 76 (60-84) years. Twenty-two patients (73%) had r/r AML. Median OS in patients treated with LDAC and nintedanib was 3.4 months, compared with 3.6 months in those treated in the placebo arm, with a HR adjusted for AML status of 1.19 (corresponding confirmatory adjusted 95% CI, 0.55-2.56; univariate log-rank P = 0.96). In the 22 patients with r/r AML, median OS was 3.0 months in the nintedanib and 3.6 months in the placebo arm (P = 0.36). One patient in the nintedanib and two patients in the placebo arm achieved a CR and entered maintenance treatment. Nintedanib showed no superior therapeutic activity over placebo when added to LDAC in elderly AML patients considered unfit for intensive chemotherapy.

To eliminate compounding effects, a uniform conditioning regimen containing antithymocyte globulin (ATG) was used.

36343893,"Mocravimod, a Selective Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor Modulator, in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Malignancy.","Dertschnig Simone, Gergely Peter, Finke Jürgen, Schanz Urs, Holler Ernst, Holtick Udo, Socié Gérard, Medinger Michael, Passweg Jakob, Teshima Takanori, Stylianou Christos, Oehen Stephan, Heim Dominik, Bucher Christoph",Transplantation and cellular therapy,"{'Year': '2023', 'Month': 'Jan'}","Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the sole curative option for patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. Outcomes are limited by leukemia relapse, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and abnormal immune reconstitution. Mocravimod (KRP203) is an oral sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator that blocks the signal required by T cells to egress from lymph nodes and other lymphoid organs. Mocravimod retains T cell effector function, a main differentiator to immunosuppressants. In preclinical models, mocravimod improves survival by maintaining graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity while reducing GVHD. In patients undergoing allo-HSCT for hematological malignancies, mocravimod is postulated to prevent GVHD by redistributing allogeneic donor T cells to lymphoid tissues while allowing a sufficient GVL effect in the lymphoid, where malignant cells usually reside. The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of mocravimod in patients undergoing allo-HSCT for hematologic malignancies. Secondary objectives were to determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of mocravimod and its active metabolite mocravimod-phosphate in this patient group, as well as to assess GVHD-free, relapse free survival at 6 months after the last treatment. In this 2-part, single- and 2-arm randomized, open-label trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of mocravimod in allo-HSCT recipients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01830010). Patients received either 1 mg or 3 mg mocravimod per day on top of standard of care GVHD prophylaxis with either cyclosporine A/methotrexate or tacrolimus/methotrexate. We found that mocravimod can be safely added to standard treatment regimens in patients with hematologic malignancies requiring allo-HSCT. Mocravimod resulted in a significant reduction of circulating lymphocyte numbers and had no negative impact on engraftment and transplantation outcomes. Our results indicate that mocravimod is safe and support a larger study to investigate its efficacy in a homogeneous acute myelogenous leukemia patient population undergoing allo-HSCT.","Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans, Graft vs Host Disease, Hematologic Neoplasms, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Immunosuppressive Agents, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Methotrexate, Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptors","ListElement([StringElement('Allogeneic HSCT', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Graft-versus-host disease', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Graft-versus-leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Mocravimod', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('S1PR modulator', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT01830010']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Randomized Controlled Trial', attributes={'UI': 'D016449'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT01830010,"A Two-part Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of KRP203 in Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant for Hematological Malignancies","A Two-part, Single- and Two Arm Randomized, Open-label Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Efficacy (in Part 2 Only) of KRP203 in Patients Undergoing Stem Cell Transplant for Hematological Malignancies","Two part study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy (in Part 2 only) of KRP203 in patients undergoing allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplant for hematological malignancies",2013-06-28,2018-08-21,PHASE1,23,"**Number of participants with Adverse Events as a Measure of safety**

It is unknown, however, whether integrating MRD with molecular profiling better identifies patients at risk of relapse. To investigate the clinical relevance of MRD in relation to a molecular-based prognostic schema, we measured MRD by flow cytometry in 189 AML patients enrolled in ECOG-ACRIN E1900 trial (NCT00049517) in morphologic complete remission (CR) (28.8 % of the original cohort) representing 44.4 % of CR patients. MRD positivity was defined as ≥ 0.1 % of leukemic bone marrow cells. Risk classification was based on standard cytogenetics, fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization, somatic gene analysis, and sparse whole genome sequencing for copy number ascertainment. At 84.6 months median follow-up of patients still alive at the time of analysis (range 47.0-120 months), multivariate analysis demonstrated that MRD status at CR (p = 0.001) and integrated molecular risk (p = 0.0004) independently predicted overall survival (OS). Among risk classes, MRD status significantly affected OS only in the favorable risk group (p = 0.002). Expression of CD25 (α-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor) by leukemic myeloblasts at diagnosis negatively affected OS independent of post-treatment MRD levels. These data suggest that integrating MRD with genetic profiling and pre-treatment CD25 expression may improve prognostication in AML.","Clinical Trial, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans, Flow Cytometry, Genomics, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Neoplasm, Residual, Prognosis","ListElement([StringElement('Acute myeloid leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('CD25', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Flow cytometry', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Genomic profiling', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('MRD', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Measurable residual disease', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Minimal residual disease', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT00049517']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Clinical Trial', attributes={'UI': 'D016430'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT00049517,Combination Chemotherapy With or Without Monoclonal Antibody Therapy in Treating Patients With AML Leukemia,A Phase III Trial in Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia: Daunorubicin Dose-Intensification Prior to Risk-Allocated Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation,"RATIONALE: Giving combination chemotherapy before a stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells.

After induction, Tg(<i>drl</i>:<i>hoxa9</i>;<i>hsp70</i>:<i>meis1</i>) embryos developed a preleukaemic state with reduced myeloid and erythroid differentiation coupled with the poor production of haematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitors. Importantly, most adult Tg(<i>drl</i>:<i>hoxa9</i>;<i>hsp70</i>:<i>meis1</i>) fish at 3 months old showed abundant accumulations of immature myeloid precursors, interrupted differentiation and anaemia in the kidney marrow, and infiltration of myeloid precursors in peripheral blood, resembling human AML. Genome-wide transcriptional analysis also confirmed AML transformation by the transgene. Moreover, the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitor that reduces leukaemogenesis in mammals effectively restored haematopoiesis in Tg(<i>drl</i>:<i>hoxa9</i>;<i>hsp70</i>:<i>meis1</i>) embryos and improved their late survival. Thus, Tg(<i>drl</i>:<i>hoxa9</i>;<i>hsp70</i>:<i>meis1</i>) zebrafish is a rapid-onset high-penetrance AML-like disease model, which provides a novel tool to harness the unique advantages of zebrafish for mechanistic studies and drug screening against <i>HOXA9</i>/<i>MEIS1</i> overexpressed high-risk AML.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Child, Preschool, Humans, Animals, Genetically Modified, Homeodomain Proteins, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mammals, Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein, Neoplasm Proteins, Penetrance, Zebrafish","ListElement([StringElement('acute myeloid leukaemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('hoxa9', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('meis1', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('myeloid malignancy', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('transgenic zebrafish model', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'figshare', 'AccessionNumberList': ['10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6251484']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",figshare,10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6251484,,,,,,,,,,

However, relapse rate was still very high for advanced-stage leukemia.

It was found in our previous study that infusion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-primed peripheral blood progenitor cells (GPBPC) instead of non-primed lymphocytes exhibited a comparative or stronger graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and comparative or less incidence of GVHD, rarely being complicated with pancytopenia. When GPBPC infusion was combined with the use of short-term immunosuppressant for GVHD prophylaxis, the incidence of fatal GVHD complicated with GPBPCI was further reduced. Our primary data showed the GPBPCI combined with the use of short-term immunosuppressant was feasible in patients with advanced leukemia to prevent relapse after HLA-mismatched HSCT.

Patient were assessed 8 times over 2 years. Time-dependent regression models were used. Among 692 patients that were evaluable, 46% received HCT with a 2-year survival of 58%. In unadjusted models, HCT was associated with reduced risks of mortality most of the subgroups. However, after accounting for covariates associated with increased mortality (age, comorbidity burden, disease risks, frailty, impaired QOL, depression, and impaired function), the associations between HCT and longer survival disappeared in most subgroups. Although function, social life, performance status, and depressive symptoms were better for those selected for HCT, these health advantages were lost after receiving HCT. Recipients and nonrecipients of HCT similarly ranked and expected cure as main goal of therapy, whereas physicians had greater expectations for cure than the former. Accounting for health impairments negates survival benefits from HCT for AML, suggesting that the unadjusted observed benefit is mostly owing to selection of the healthier candidates.

Thus, understanding the unique molecular changes elicited by the marrow is of critical importance toward improving therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we demonstrate that aberrant activation of oxidative phosphorylation serves to induce therapeutic resistance in FLT3 mutant human AML cells challenged with FLT3 inhibitor drugs. Importantly, our findings show that AML cells are protected from apoptosis following FLT3 inhibition due to marrow-mediated activation of ATM, which in turn upregulates oxidative phosphorylation via mTOR signaling. mTOR is required for the bone marrow stroma-dependent maintenance of protein translation, with selective polysome enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation transcripts, despite FLT3 inhibition. To investigate the therapeutic significance of this finding, we tested the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib in primary human AML xenograft models. While marrow resident AML cells were highly resistant to quizartinib alone, the addition of everolimus induced profound reduction in tumor burden and prevented relapse. Taken together, these data provide a novel mechanistic understanding of marrow-based therapeutic resistance and a promising strategy for improved treatment of FLT3 mutant AML patients.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Everolimus, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases, Apoptosis, fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3, Cell Line, Tumor, Phosphorylation, Mutation, Tumor Microenvironment","ListElement([StringElement('AML', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('bone marrow', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cancer biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('drug resistance', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('human', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE202230', 'GSE61019']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE202230,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven patients (26%) experienced grade ≥3 bleeding events, which were observed most frequently with the 80 mg BID dose. We conducted platelet aggregation studies to investigate the potential role of mivavotinib-mediated SYK inhibition on platelet function. The bleeding events observed may have been the result of several confounding factors, including AML disease status, associated thrombocytopenia, and high doses of mivavotinib.

Allogeneic CAR-T cells, generated from healthy donor T cells, can provide ready-to-use, blast-free therapeutic products, but their application could be complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and host rejection. Here we developed healthy donor-derived, CD7-targeting CAR-T cells (RD13-01) with genetic modifications to resist fratricide, GvHD and allogeneic rejection, as well as to potentiate antitumor function. A phase I clinical trial (NCT04538599) was conducted with twelve patients recruited (eleven with T cell leukemia/lymphoma, and one with CD7-expressing acute myeloid leukemia). All patients achieved pre-set end points and eleven proceeded to efficacy evaluation. No dose-limiting toxicity, GvHD, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity or severe cytokine release syndrome (grade ≥ 3) were observed. 28 days post infusion, 81.8% of patients (9/11) showed objective responses and the complete response rate was 63.6% (7/11, including the patient with AML). 3 of the responding patients were bridged to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. With a median follow-up of 10.5 months, 4 patients remained in complete remission.

The IDH2 inhibitor enasidenib was recently approved for IDH2-mutated relapsed or refractory AML. We conducted a multi-center, phase I trial of maintenance enasidenib following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with IDH2-mutated myeloid malignancies. Two dose levels, 50mg and 100mg daily were studied in a 3 × 3 dose-escalation design, with 10 additional patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Enasidenib was initiated between days 30 and 90 following HCT and continued for twelve 28-day cycles. Twenty-three patients were enrolled, of whom 19 initiated post-HCT maintenance. Two had myelodysplastic syndrome, and 17 had AML. All but 3 were in first complete remission. No dose limiting toxicities were observed, and the RP2D was established at 100mg daily. Attributable grade ≥3 toxicities were rare, with the most common being cytopenias. Eight patients stopped maintenance before completing 12 cycles, due to adverse events (n=3), pursuing treatment for graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) (n=2), clinician choice (n=1), relapse (n=1), and COVID infection (n=1). No cases of grade ≥3 acute GVHD were seen, and 12-month cumulative incidence of moderate/severe chronic GVHD was 42% (20-63%).

The maximum tolerated dose of Enasidenib in this patient population. The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose level at which 0 or 1 of six patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). MTD is determined using a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation cohort, where 3 participants will be enrolled on the starting dose of 50 mg daily and if no DLT is experienced after a full 28-day cycle, 3 additional participants will be enrolled at the next dose level of 100mg daily. If during any dose level, 1 patient out of 3 develops a DLT, then 3 additional patients will be added to that dose level. If 2 out of the 3 patients placed on any dose level experience a DLT, the preceding dose is considered MTD. If 1 out of 6 participants has a DLT, the next higher dose level will commence accrual. If ≥ 2 of 6 patients have a DLT, then the preceding dose will be considered MTD.

*Time Frame:* 28 Days

**Number of participants with dose limiting toxicities (DLT)**

Dose limiting toxicities are adverse events that occur during the first 28-day cycle that are considered serious enough to prevent an increase in the Enasidenib dose level. Adverse events are graded and documented per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4).

*Time Frame:* 28 days
","**The number of participants with Enasidenib related adverse events**

The number of participants with treatment related adverse events grouped by grade. Adverse events are assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE 4). Adverse events are considered to be related to treatment if they are deemed to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment with Enasidenib by the investigator.

*Time Frame:* From the start of treatment until 30 days after the end of treatment, treatment may continue for up to 12 28-day cycles

**Cumulative incidence of acute GVHD**

The cumulative incidence of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). Acute GVHD is graded according to a composite grading of the clinical stages of skin rash, liver function, and intestinal tract function. Skin rash is assessed by the portion of the body covered by rash, liver function is assessed based on blood bilirubin levels, and intestinal track function is assessed based on the volume of diarrhea per day. The acute GVHD grade ranges from 1 to 4 with 1 representing less severe effects and 4 the most severe. The incidence represents the proportion of participants that experienced any grade acute GVHD.

*Time Frame:* Cycle 1 days 1, 8, and 15; day 1 of every subsequent cycle (cycles are 28-days), up to 100 days after the start of treatment

**Cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD**

Cumulative incidence of chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). cGHVD is assessed as per the National Institutes of Health consensus development project on criteria for clinical trials in cGVHD. cGVHD is graded as mild, moderate, or severe. The cGVHD grade is based on an aggregate score of different organ systems. The organ systems are graded from 0 to 3, with 0 being no-symptoms and 3 being the most severe symptoms. The cumulative incidence represents the proportion of participants that have any grade cGVHD.

cGVHD Grade:

* Mild: Involves only 1 or 2 organs or sites (except the lung), with no clinically significant functional impairment
* Moderate: Involves at least 1 organ or site with clinically significant but no major disability or 3 or more organs or sites with no clinically significant functional impairment. A lung score of 1 will also be considered moderate cGVHD
* Severe: Indicates major disability caused by cGVHD. A lung score of 2 will also be considered severe cGVHD

Stromal cells have been shown to support AML survival and progression through various mechanisms. Nonetheless, whether AML cells could establish beneficial metabolic interactions with stromal cells is underexplored. By using a combination of human AML cell lines and AML patient samples together with mouse stromal cells and a MLL-AF9 mouse model, here we identify a novel metabolic crosstalk between AML and stromal cells where AML cells prompt stromal cells to secrete acetate for their own consumption to feed the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and lipid biosynthesis. By performing transcriptome analysis and tracer-based metabolic NMR analysis, we observe that stromal cells present a higher rate of glycolysis when co-cultured with AML cells. We also find that acetate in stromal cells is derived from pyruvate via chemical conversion under the influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following ROS transfer from AML to stromal cells via gap junctions. Overall, we present a unique metabolic communication between AML and stromal cells and propose two different molecular targets, ACSS2 and gap junctions, that could potentially be exploited for adjuvant therapy.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Acetates, Animals, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Lipids, Mice, Pyruvates, Reactive Oxygen Species, Signal Transduction, Stromal Cells, Tumor Microenvironment","ListElement([StringElement('acute myeloid leukaemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('biochemistry', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cancer biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('chemical biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('human', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('metabolism', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('microenvironment', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('mouse', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('nuclear magnetic resonance', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE163478', 'GSE128423']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE163478,,,,,,,,,,

Successful treatment of AML is dependent on what subtype of AML the participant has, and the age of the participant when diagnosed.

Venetoclax is an experimental drug that kills cancer cells by blocking a protein (part of a cell) that allows cancer cells to stay alive. This study is designed to see if adding venetoclax to azacitidine works better than azacitidine on its own.

This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind (treatment is unknown to participants and doctors), placebo controlled study in patients with AML who are \>= 18 or more years old and have not been treated before. Participants who take part in this study should not be suitable for standard induction therapy (usual starting treatment). AbbVie is funding this study which will take place at approximately 180 hospitals globally and enroll approximately 400 participants.

In this study, 2/3 of participants will receive venetoclax every day with azacitidine and the remaining 1/3 will receive placebo (dummy) tablets with azacitidine.

Participants will continue to have study visits and receive treatment for as long as they are having a clinical benefit. The effect of the treatment on AML will be checked by taking blood, bone marrow, scans, measuring side effects and by completing health questionnaires. Blood and bone marrow tests will be completed to see why some people respond better than others.

The FACIT-Fatigue Scale is a short, 13-item, self-administered tool that measures the level of fatigue in an individual during usually daily activities over the past week. The level of fatigue is measured on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = not at all; 4 = very much. The scores range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating less fatigue. If there were missing items, but the participant answered at least 50% of the items, then subscores were prorated.

The EQ-5D-3L is a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 5 questions, pertaining to specific health dimensions (ie, mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, and anxiety/depression) and a health status scale. Each question has 3 levels of severity, corresponding to no problems, moderate problems and severe problems. Canadian population sample weights were used to derive health utility scores. A higher utility score represents a better health state. A clinically meaningful improvement or worsening was defined as at least 0.08 points of improvement or 0.10 points of worsening from baseline, respectively, for the EQ-5D-3L Health Utility Index. The instrument is scored using the United Kingdom (UK) index ranges from -0.594 to 1, where 0 equates to death and 1 equates to full health; -0.594 is considered 'worse than death'.

This multicenter, open-label, phase 3 trial randomized (2:1) untreated adults with FLT3mut+ AML ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy to receive gilteritinib (120 mg/d orally) and azacitidine (GIL + AZA) or azacitidine (AZA) alone. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). At the interim analysis (August 26, 2020), a total of 123 patients were randomized to treatment (GIL + AZA, n = 74; AZA, n = 49). Subsequent AML therapy, including FLT3 inhibitors, was received by 20.3% (GIL + AZA) and 44.9% (AZA) of patients. Median OS was 9.82 (GIL + AZA) and 8.87 (AZA) months (hazard ratio, 0.916; 95% CI, 0.529-1.585; P = .753). The study was closed based on the protocol-specified boundary for futility. Median event-free survival was 0.03 month in both arms. Event-free survival defined by using composite complete remission (CRc) was 4.53 months for GIL + AZA and 0.03 month for AZA (hazard ratio, 0.686; 95% CI, 0.433-1.087; P = .156).

AML is a type of cancer. It is when bone marrow makes white blood cells that are not normal. These are called leukemia cells. Some patients with AML have a mutation, or change, in the FLT3 gene. This gene helps leukemia cells make a protein called FLT3. This protein causes the leukemia cells to grow faster.

For patients with AML who cannot receive standard chemotherapy, azacitidine (also known as Vidaza®) is a current standard of care treatment option in the United States. This clinical study is testing an experimental medicine called ASP2215, also known as gilteritinib. Gilteritinib works by stopping the leukemia cells from making the FLT3 protein. This can help stop the leukemia cells from growing faster.

This study will compare two different treatments. Patients are assigned to one of these two groups by chance: a medicine called azacitidine, also known as Vidaza®, or an experimental medicine gilteritinib in combination with azacitidine. There is a twice as much chance to receive both medicines combined than azacitidine alone.

To delineate the mechanistic basis of resistance to gilteritinib, we performed targeted sequencing and scRNASeq on primary FLT3-ITD-mutated AML samples. Co-occurring mutations in RAS pathway genes were the most common genetic abnormalities, and unresponsiveness to gilteritinib was associated with increased expression of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cytokines and chemokines. In particular, we found elevated expression of the TEK-family kinase, BMX, in gilteritinib-unresponsive patients pre- and post-treatment. BMX contributed to gilteritinib resistance in FLT3-mutant cell lines in a hypoxia-dependent manner by promoting pSTAT5 signaling, and these phenotypes could be reversed with pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout. We also observed that inhibition of BMX in primary FLT3-mutated AML samples decreased chemokine secretion and enhanced the activity of gilteritinib. Collectively, these findings indicate a crucial role for microenvironment-mediated factors modulated by BMX in the escape from targeted therapy and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to restore sensitivity to gilteritinib.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Aniline Compounds, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mutation, Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, Pyrazines, Tumor Microenvironment, fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'Dryad', 'AccessionNumberList': ['10.5061/dryad.zgmsbccdc']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",Dryad,10.5061/dryad.zgmsbccdc,,,,,,,,,,

The dose of RIF remains to be determined in pediatric patients. Comparison of plasma arsenic concentrations and toxicity between RIF and arsenic trioxide (ATO) treatment in APL may help to establish an appropriate therapeutic dose of RIF for children. From October 2018 to March 2020, 19 pediatric patients with APL treated with SCCLG-APL protocol were included, 9 in RIF group at 135 mg/kg/day orally three times daily, and 10 in ATO group at 0.16 mg/kg/day intravenously over 12 h daily. Peak and trough plasma arsenic concentrations were assayed at D1, 2, 7 and 14 of induction treatment. Urine arsenic excretions were assessed with spot urine samples and the measurements were adjusted using creatinine. Toxicities were compared between two groups. The plasma arsenic concentration reached steady state at D7 either in the RIF or ATO group, and the mean peak and trough concentrations were similar between two groups (P > 0.05), which were 0.54 μmol/L and 0.48 μmol/L in RIF group, and 0.63 μmol/L and 0.51 μmol/L in ATO group, respectively. Urine arsenic excretion rate was positively correlated with the concentration of plasma arsenic. The rates of treatment-related adverse events were similar in two groups. In conclusion, the dose of RIF at 135 mg/kg/day may be an appropriate therapeutic dose in children with APL. Urine arsenic level can be used as an indicator to estimate plasma arsenic concentration.

Recently, a randomized prospective study showed that the addition of ATO to ""ATRA + chemotherapy"" treatment protocol had a significantly higher EFS in patients with APL than those treated with ""ATRA + chemotherapy"" protocol.

**Mean Change in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT-Fatigue Scale V 4.0) Score From Baseline**

The functional assessment of chronic illness therapy (FACIT-Fatigue Scale V 4.0) is a subscale of the FACIT-F and has been validated in the oncology setting. The FACIT-Fatigue Scale is a short, 13-item, self-administered tool that measures the level of fatigue in an individual during usually daily activities over the past week.

We evaluated the predictive utility of GA among older adults treated with low-intensity therapy on a multisite trial. We conducted a companion study (CALGB 361101) to a randomized phase 2 trial (CALGB 11002) of adults ≥60 years and considered ""unfit"" for intensive therapy, testing the efficacy of adding bortezomib to decitabine therapy. On 361101, GA and quality of life (QOL) assessment was administered prior to treatment and every other subsequent cycle. Relationships between baseline GA and QOL measures with survival were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazards models. One-hundred sixty-five patients enrolled in CALGB 11002, and 96 (52%) of them also enrolled in 361101 (median age, 73.9 years). Among participants, 85.4% completed ≥1 baseline assessment. In multivariate analyses, greater comorbidity (hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index >3), worse cognition (Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration score >4), and lower European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer global QOL scores at baseline were significantly associated with shorter overall survival (P < .05 each) after adjustment for Karnofsky Performance Status, age, and treatment arm.

A previously completed phase I study of devimistat in combination with cytarabine and mitoxantrone in patients with relapsed or refractory AML showed promising response rates. Here we report the results of a single arm phase II study (NCT02484391). The primary outcome of feasibility of maintenance devimistat following induction and consolidation with devimistat in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone was not met, as maintenance devimistat was only administered in 2 of 21 responders. The secondary outcomes of response (CR + CRi) and median survival were 44% (21/48) and 5.9 months respectively. There were no unexpected toxicities observed. An unplanned, post-hoc analysis of the phase I and II datasets suggests a trend of a dose response in older but not younger patients. RNA sequencing data from patient samples reveals an age-related decline in mitochondrial gene sets. Devimistat impairs ATP synthesis and we find a correlation between mitochondrial membrane potential and sensitivity to chemotherapy. Devimistat also induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and turnover consistent with mitophagy. We find that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of mitochondrial fission or autophagy sensitizes cells to devimistat. These findings suggest that an age related decline in mitochondrial quality and autophagy may be associated with response to devimistat however this needs to be confirmed in larger cohorts with proper trial design.","Clinical Trial, Phase I, Clinical Trial, Phase II, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Aged, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, Caprylates, Cytarabine, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mitoxantrone, Sulfides, Treatment Outcome",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT02484391']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase I', attributes={'UI': 'D017426'}), StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase II', attributes={'UI': 'D017427'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02484391,"CPI-613, Cytarabine, and Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride in Treating Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Granulocytic Sarcoma",An Open Label Study to Evaluate the Feasibility of CPI-613 Given With High Dose Cytarabine and Mitoxantrone in Patients With Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML),"This pilot phase I trial studies how well CPI-613 (6,8-bis\[benzylthio\]octanoic acid), cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia or granulocytic sarcoma (a malignant, green-colored tumor of myeloid cells \[a type of immature white blood cell\]) that has returned (relapsed) or that does not respond to treatment (refractory). 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid is thought to kill cancer cells by turning off their mitochondria.

Despite relative improvements in survival for patients with newly diagnosed AML, an estimated 40-60% will relapse with the majority eventually dying of their relapsed disease.

As chemotherapy resistance is one of the primary drivers of poor treatment response and subsequent relapse in AML, identifying methods to reverse this resistance are desperately needed. This clinical trial is aimed at improving the remission re-Induction rates for children and adults with relapsed or refractory AML through epigenetic modifying agents that have the ability to reverse chemotherapy resistance. Decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) and Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), are two epigenetic modifying drugs that act on the methylation of proximal promoter regions of genes and on proteins involved in the wrapping of DNA around histones, respectively. Both processes play a critical role in regulating gene expression, and frequently these genes are involved in chemotherapy resistance.

Our purpose is to assess the long-term efficacy of preemptive IFN-α therapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients following allo-HSCT based on two registry studies (#NCT02185261 and #NCT02027064). We would present the final data and unpublished results of long-term clinical outcomes with extended follow-up. We adopted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) to monitor MRD, and a positive result of bone marrow specimen examined by either of them would be identified as the MRD-positive status. Subcutaneous injections of recombinant human IFN-α-2b were performed for 6 cycles, and prolonged IFN-α therapy could be permitted at the request of patients. The median cycles were 3.5 (range, 0.5-30.5) cycles. A total of 9 patients suffered from grade ≥3 toxicities (i.e., infectious: n = 6; hematologic: n = 3). The 6-year cumulative incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality following IFN-α therapy were 13.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4-20.6%) and 3.9% (95%CI, 0.0-17.6%), respectively. The probability of disease-free survival at 6 years following IFN-α therapy was 83.1% (95%CI, 75.2-91.9%).

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is an effective treatment option for acute leukemia and many other hematological malignancies. However, post-transplant relapse can occur in some patients, and the prognosis of these patients is usually very poor.The persistence or recurrence of minimal residual disease (MRD) in the post-transplant period is an independent risk factor of relapse. Therefore, MRD monitoring can be used to screen patients with a high risk of relapse to provide timely intervention and prevent post-transplant relapse.Interferon α-2b exerts a relatively strong immunomodulatory effect. It can kill acute leukemia (AL) cells by regulating T-cell and/or natural killer cell functions.Consequently, interferon α-2b may have potential therapeutic value for AL patients with MRD-positive after transplantation.

Baseline comutations, FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) allelic ratio and length, and treatment-emergent mutations were analyzed in patients in the ADMIRAL trial. Baseline comutations were grouped according to gene subgroups (DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation, transcription, chromatin-spliceosome, receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras signaling, TP53-aneuploidy, NPM1, DNMT3A, DNMT3A/NPM1, WT-1, and IDH1/IDH2). Across all but 1 gene subgroup (TP53-aneuploidy), higher pretransplant response rates and a trend toward longer overall survival were observed with gilteritinib vs SC. Patients with DNMT3A/NPM1 comutations who received gilteritinib had the most favorable outcomes of any molecular subgroup analyzed. Survival outcomes with gilteritinib were not adversely affected by FLT3-ITD allelic ratio, FLT3-ITD length, or multiple FLT3-ITD mutations. Among patients who relapsed on gilteritinib, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and FLT3 F691L gene mutations were the most common mutational events associated with treatment resistance. However, the occurrence of Ras/MAPK pathway gene mutations at baseline did not preclude a clinical benefit from gilteritinib. Acquisition of multiple Ras/MAPK pathway gene mutations at relapse suggests a high level of pathway reactivation is needed to overcome the gilteritinib treatment effect. These findings provide insight into the R/R AML molecular profile and the impact of FLT3 inhibitors on mutational evolution associated with treatment resistance and benefit of gilteritinib across a wide spectrum of molecular and genetic subgroups in FLT3-mutated R/R AML.

Participants who died without report of relapse were considered nonevents and censored at their last relapse-free disease assessment date (last relapse-free disease assessment date - first CRc or PR disease assessment date + 1). Other participants who did not relapse during the study were considered nonevents and censored at the last relapse-free assessment date. Duration of CR was only applicable to participants with best overall response of CR.

**Change From Baseline in Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)**

The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a screening tool designed to assess the severity and impact of fatigue on daily functioning of participants with cancer during the 24 hours. There are 9 items on the scale. The first three questions ask participants to rate their fatigues on a scale from 0 (no fatigue) - 10 (as bad as you can imagine), with higher scores indicating worse outcome. The remaining six questions ask participants to rate how much fatigue has interfered with their daily activities on a scale from 0 (Does not interfere) to 10 (Completely interferes). A global fatigue score can be obtained by averaging all the items on the BFI. The global BFI score will be calculated only if at least 5 of the 9 items are answered. A higher BFI fatigue score indicates worse outcome.

*Time Frame:* Baseline and cycle 1, day 8 and cycle 2 day 1 (up to data cut off date of 17 Sep 2018)

**Percentage of Participants With Complete Remission (CR) With Partial Hematological Recovery (CRh)**

**Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Transfusion Conversion and Maintenance**

Transfusion conversion \& maintenance rate was defined for gilteritinib arm. Participants were classified as transfusion independent if there were no RBC or platelet transfusions within 28 days prior to the first dose to 28 days after the first dose; otherwise they were classified as transfusion dependent at baseline. Participants were considered independent postbaseline if they had 1 consecutive 8 week period without any RBC or platelet transfusion from 29 days after the first dose until the last dose date. For participants who were on treatment ≤ 4 weeks or \> 4 weeks but \< 12 weeks and there was no RBC or platelet transfusion within postbaseline period, they were considered not evaluable; otherwise, they were considered postbaseline transfusion dependent. Transfusion conversion rate was defined for participants who had evaluable postbaseline transfusion status. Transfusion status (independent vs. dependent) at baseline and postbaseline was reported in a 2 by 2 contingency table.

*Time Frame:* From randomization until the data cut-off date of 17 Sep 2018, median treatment duration for gilteritinib was (126.00 [4.0, 885.0]) days versus salvage chemotherapy 28.0 [5.0, 217.0] days)

**Number of Participants With Adverse Events**

A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an AE observed after starting administration of the study drug (gilteritinib or salvage chemotherapy). If the AE occurred on day 1 and the onset check box was marked ""Onset after first dose of study drug"" or the onset check box was left blank, then the AE was considered treatment emergent. If the AE occurred on day 1 and the onset check box was marked ""Onset before first dose of study drug"", then the AE was not considered treatment emergent. Majority of salvage chemotherapy participants finished the study by cycle 2 of treatment, the duration of exposure was longer in the gilteritinib arm compared with the salvage chemotherapy arm (126.00 \[4.0, 885.0\] days versus 28.0 \[5.0, 217.0\] days).

Here we provide a follow-up of the ADMIRAL trial 2 years after the primary analysis to clarify the long-term treatment effects and safety of gilteritinib in these patients with AML. At the time of this analysis, the median survival follow-up was 37.1 months, with deaths in 203 of 247 and 97 of 124 patients in the gilteritinib and SC arms, respectively; 16 gilteritinib-treated patients remained on treatment. The median overall survival for the gilteritinib and SC arms was 9.3 and 5.6 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.665; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.518, 0.853; two-sided P = .0013); 2-year estimated survival rates were 20.6% (95% CI, 15.8, 26.0) and 14.2% (95% CI, 8.3, 21.6). The gilteritinib-arm 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse after composite complete remission was 75.7%, with few relapses occurring after 18 months. Overall, 49 of 247 patients in the gilteritinib arm and 14 of 124 patients in the SC arm were alive for ≥2 years. Twenty-six gilteritinib-treated patients remained alive for ≥2 years without relapse; 18 of these patients underwent transplantation (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) and 16 restarted gilteritinib as post-HSCT maintenance therapy. The most common adverse events of interest during years 1 and 2 of gilteritinib therapy were increased liver transaminase levels; adverse event incidence decreased in year 2. Thus, continued and post-HSCT gilteritinib maintenance treatment sustained remission with a stable safety profile.

**Change From Baseline in Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI)**

The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a screening tool designed to assess the severity and impact of fatigue on daily functioning of participants with cancer during the 24 hours. There are 9 items on the scale. The first three questions ask participants to rate their fatigues on a scale from 0 (no fatigue) - 10 (as bad as you can imagine), with higher scores indicating worse outcome. The remaining six questions ask participants to rate how much fatigue has interfered with their daily activities on a scale from 0 (Does not interfere) to 10 (Completely interferes). A global fatigue score can be obtained by averaging all the items on the BFI. The global BFI score will be calculated only if at least 5 of the 9 items are answered. A higher BFI fatigue score indicates worse outcome.

Successful treatment of AML is dependent on what subtype of AML the participant has, and the age of the participant when diagnosed.

Venetoclax is an experimental drug that kills cancer cells by blocking a protein (part of a cell) that allows cancer cells to stay alive. This study is designed to see if adding venetoclax to azacitidine works better than azacitidine on its own.

This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind (treatment is unknown to participants and doctors), placebo controlled study in patients with AML who are \>= 18 or more years old and have not been treated before. Participants who take part in this study should not be suitable for standard induction therapy (usual starting treatment). AbbVie is funding this study which will take place at approximately 180 hospitals globally and enroll approximately 400 participants.

In this study, 2/3 of participants will receive venetoclax every day with azacitidine and the remaining 1/3 will receive placebo (dummy) tablets with azacitidine.

Participants will continue to have study visits and receive treatment for as long as they are having a clinical benefit. The effect of the treatment on AML will be checked by taking blood, bone marrow, scans, measuring side effects and by completing health questionnaires.

Successful treatment of AML is dependent on what subtype of AML the participant has, and the age of the participant when diagnosed.

Venetoclax is an experimental drug that kills cancer cells by blocking a protein (part of a cell) that allows cancer cells to stay alive. This study is designed to see if adding venetoclax to azacitidine works better than azacitidine on its own.

This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind (treatment is unknown to participants and doctors), placebo controlled study in patients with AML who are \>= 18 or more years old and have not been treated before. Participants who take part in this study should not be suitable for standard induction therapy (usual starting treatment). AbbVie is funding this study which will take place at approximately 180 hospitals globally and enroll approximately 400 participants.

In this study, 2/3 of participants will receive venetoclax every day with azacitidine and the remaining 1/3 will receive placebo (dummy) tablets with azacitidine.

Participants will continue to have study visits and receive treatment for as long as they are having a clinical benefit. The effect of the treatment on AML will be checked by taking blood, bone marrow, scans, measuring side effects and by completing health questionnaires.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is fatal if not treated. Treatment for AML that has not responded to treatment (refractory) or has returned after treatment (relapsed) often do not work. Researchers want to see if an immunotherapy drug, combined with a less intense chemotherapy, may be able to help.

Objective:

To test if pembrolizumab, in combination with decitabine, is a possible treatment for people with relapsed or refractory AML.

Eligibility:

Adults 18 years of age and older with refractory AML or relapsed AML.

Design:

Participants will be first screened for eligibility.

The study is counted in 21-day cycles. The initial phase of the study consists of 8 cycles. Participants may be in the study for up to 2 years if they are responding to the treatment.

The first 3 weeks of treatment is usually done in the hospital. The rest may be done as an outpatient.

Participants will get pembrolizumab at the beginning of each cycle through an IV.

Participants will usually get decitabine by IV on days 8 12 and days 15 19 of every other cycle.

Participants will give blood samples.

Participants will have bone marrow exams. A needle will be inserted into the hip to extract cells from the bone marrow.

Some participants may give a sample of saliva from the inside of their cheek.

Some participants may give a small skin sample. The top layer of the skin is removed.

After giving the patient chemotherapy and total body irradiation to stop the growth of cancer and remove the patient's diseased bone marrow, healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient to replace the patient's bone marrow and make red and white blood cells and platelets. Unfortunately HSCT is often complicated by 'graft versus host disease' (GVHD) in which the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells and cause tissue damage and severe symptoms. Removing a subset of the donor T cells, called 'naive T cells', before transplant may reduce the frequency and intensity of GVHD.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial will determine whether the removal of the naive T cells from donor cells can decrease the rate and severity of graft-vs-host disease while preserving specific immunity against infections in patients with acute leukemia or advanced myelodysplastic syndromes.",2009-12-17,2019-12-01,PHASE2,41,"**Number of Participants With Acute Graft-vs-host Disease (GVHD): Grade I-IV, Including Those With no Reportable Acute GVHD**

In the phase 3 QUAZAR AML-001 trial, oral azacitidine (oral-AZA; formerly CC-486), a hypomethylating agent, significantly prolonged OS and relapse-free survival (RFS) compared with placebo in patients aged ≥55 years with AML in first remission after intensive chemotherapy who were not candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this trial, MRD (≥0.1% leukemic cells in bone marrow) was assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry in serial samples collected at baseline and on day 1 of every 3 cycles. As expected, baseline MRD status was significantly associated with both OS and RFS. Multivariate analyses showed oral-AZA significantly improved OS and RFS vs placebo independent of baseline MRD status. Oral-AZA treatment also extended the duration of MRD negativity by 6 months vs placebo and resulted in a higher rate of conversion from MRD+ at baseline to MRD- during treatment: 37% vs 19%, respectively.

We hypothesized that TCRαβ/CD19-depletion would attenuate the risks of GVHD and relapse for URD HSCT.

Previous studies showed that natural killer (NK) cells can be stimulated ex vivo with interleukin-12 (IL-12), -15, and -18 to generate memory-like (ML) NK cells with enhanced antileukemia responses. We treated 9 pediatric/YA patients with post-HCT relapsed AML with donor ML NK cells in a phase 1 trial. Patients received fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim followed 2 weeks later by infusion of donor lymphocytes and ML NK cells from the original HCT donor. ML NK cells were successfully generated from haploidentical and matched-related and -unrelated donors. After infusion, donor-derived ML NK cells expanded and maintained an ML multidimensional mass cytometry phenotype for >3 months. Furthermore, ML NK cells exhibited persistent functional responses as evidenced by leukemia-triggered interferon-γ production. After DLI and ML NK cell adoptive transfer, 4 of 8 evaluable patients achieved complete remission at day 28. Two patients maintained a durable remission for >3 months, with 1 patient in remission for >2 years. No significant toxicity was experienced. This study demonstrates that, in a compatible post-HCT immune environment, donor ML NK cells robustly expand and persist with potent antileukemic activity in the absence of exogenous cytokines.

However, the complete remission (CR) rates and long term survival remain very poor in these patients and, therefore, there is an unmet need to develop more effective treatment approaches in patients who relapse after allo-HCT.

Based on the initial promising results with our ongoing cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) natural killer (NK) cell trial, the investigators hypothesize that combining the CIML NK cells with DLI approach will significantly enhance the graft versus leukemia and therefore potentially provide potentially curative therapy for these patients with otherwise extremely poor prognosis. Combining CIML NK cells with the DLI platform will also potentially allow these adoptively transferred cells to persist for longer duration as they should not be rejected by donor T cells as the CIML NK cells are derived from the same donor.

The broader clinical implications of PTPN11 mutations in AML are still not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine which cytogenetic abnormalities and gene mutations co-occur with PTPN11 mutations and how PTPN11 mutations affect outcomes of patients treated with intensive chemotherapy. We studied 1725 patients newly diagnosed with AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) enrolled onto the Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology trials. In 140 PTPN11-mutated patient samples, PTPN11 most commonly co-occurred with mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, and TET2. PTPN11 mutations were relatively common in patients with an inv(3)(q21q26)/t(3;3)(q21;q26) and a normal karyotype but were very rare in patients with typical complex karyotype and core-binding factor AML. Mutations in the N-terminal SH2 domain of PTPN11 were associated with a higher early death rate than those in the phosphatase domain. PTPN11 mutations did not affect outcomes of NPM1-mutated patients, but these patients were less likely to have co-occurring kinase mutations (ie, FLT3-ITD), suggesting activation of overlapping signaling pathways. However, in AML patients with wild-type NPM1, PTPN11 mutations were associated with adverse patient outcomes, providing a rationale to study the biology and treatment approaches in this molecular group.

We conducted a randomized phase 2 trial of GVAX after HSCT for myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts or relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Myeloblasts were harvested before HSCT to generate the vaccine. Randomization to GVAX vs placebo (1:1) was stratified according to disease, transplant center, and conditioning. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis included tacrolimus and methotrexate. GVAX or placebo vaccination was started between day 30 and 45 if there was engraftment and no GVHD. Vaccines were administered subcutaneously/intradermally weekly × 3, then every 2 weeks × 3. Tacrolimus taper began after vaccine completion. A total of 123 patients were enrolled, 92 proceeded to HSCT, and 57 (GVAX, n = 30; placebo, n = 27) received at least 1 vaccination. No Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3 or worse vaccine-related adverse events were reported, but injection site reactions were more common after GVAX (10 vs 1; P = .006).

Phase II clinical trials test the effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention, in this case, the GVAX vaccine, works in preventing MDS, CMML, or AML from relapsing after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. ""Investigational"" means that the vaccine is still being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the side effects it may cause, and if the vaccine is effective. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the vaccine for these types of cancer.

Participants are being asked to participate in this trial because they have advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Investigators have determined that participants are a candidate for an allogeneic stem cell transplant as treatment for MDS/CMML/AML. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a standard treatment for MDS/CMML/AML. It can be effective because the cells from the donor (also known as the graft) could form a new immune system that can fight against the MDS/CMML/AML cells in the body. This is also known as the ""graft-versus-leukemia"" or ""GVL"" effect. In patients with advanced MDS, CMML, or AML that is not in remission at the time of transplantation, relapse remains the number one cause of transplant failure. As such, this clinical trial is designed to assess whether adding a leukemia vaccine early after transplantation could stimulate donor cells to fight cancer and improve transplant outcomes.

In recent years, researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have discovered that GVAX, a vaccine made from the patient's own cancer cells engineered to produce a protein called GM-CSF, can be effective in stimulating a powerful immune response specific to that cancer. GM-CSF is a naturally occurring hormone in the body that helps the immune system fight infections and diseases. The GVAX vaccine is made in the laboratory by using a virus (called adenovirus, which has been modified so it cannot cause illness) to insert the GM-CSF gene into tumor cells. The cells are then irradiated, which prevents them from being able to grow, before being administered to patients in a series of vaccinations.

A previous phase I clinical trial using this GVAX vaccine in patients with MDS/AML after allogeneic transplantation demonstrated that the GVAX vaccine is safe, and the survival outcomes were encouraging. The current randomized phase II study will investigate this vaccine further and gather more information to assess the activity.

Participants in this study will be ""randomized"" to receive either GVAX vaccination or placebo (a saline solution) vaccination. Randomization means participants are put into a group by chance. It is like flipping a coin. There is a 50% chance they will receive the GVAX vaccine and a 50% chance they will receive placebo. Neither participants nor investigators will know which participants will be receiving.

The primary goal of this trial is to assess if there will be a difference in the percentage of cancer free survivors in the vaccinated vs. placebo group at 18 months after transplant.",2013-01-08,2020-12-11,PHASE2,123,"**18-Month Progression Free Survival**

Adoptive therapies with allogeneic, cytokine-activated NK cells are being investigated in clinical trials. However, the optimal cytokine support after adoptive transfer to promote NK cell expansion, and persistence remains unclear. Correlative studies from 2 independent clinical trial cohorts treated with major histocompatibility complex-haploidentical NK cell therapy for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia revealed that cytokine support by systemic interleukin-15 (IL-15; N-803) resulted in reduced clinical activity, compared with IL-2. We hypothesized that the mechanism responsible was IL-15/N-803 promoting recipient CD8 T-cell activation that in turn accelerated donor NK cell rejection. This idea was supported by increased proliferating CD8+ T-cell numbers in patients treated with IL-15/N-803, compared with IL-2. Moreover, mixed lymphocyte reactions showed that IL-15/N-803 enhanced responder CD8 T-cell activation and proliferation, compared with IL-2 alone. Additionally, IL-15/N-803 accelerated the ability of responding T cells to kill stimulator-derived memory-like NK cells, demonstrating that additional IL-15 can hasten donor NK cell elimination. Thus, systemic IL-15 used to support allogeneic cell therapy may paradoxically limit their therapeutic window of opportunity and clinical activity. This study indicates that stimulating patient CD8 T-cell allo-rejection responses may critically limit allogeneic cellular therapy supported with IL-15.

Monitoring the peripheral blood blast burden during induction by flow cytometry has shown significant value in the evaluation of treatment responses. Our previous study reported the day 5 peripheral blast clearance rate (D5-PBCR) as an indicator of early treatment response, and D5-PBCR (+) patients showed poor outcomes. We performed the present phase 2 trial of early intervention in D5-PBCR (+) patients with homoharringtonine (HHT) introduced in the traditional induction regimen with anthracycline and cytarabine. The primary endpoint was complete remission (CR). This study enrolled 151 patients, 65 patients were D5-PBCR (+) and 55 patients completed induction with HHT addition. The overall CR rate after one course of induction was 84.4%, with 87.5% and 80.0% for the D5-PBCR (-) and D5-PBCR (+) groups, respectively. The incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was comparable between the two groups. At the median follow-up of 53.1 months, median overall survival (OS) was not reached in the entire cohort, and median event-free survival (EFS) was 42.2 months. Neither the OS nor EFS showed significant differences between the D5-PBCR (-) and D5-PBCR (+) groups. Compared to historical data, significant improvements in both OS (p = .020) and EFS (p = .020) were observed in the D5-PBCR (+) group. In conclusion, optimization of induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine according to D5-PBCR is feasible in patients with newly diagnosed AML. The addition of HHT demonstrated a good efficacy and safety profile.","Clinical Trial, Phase II, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, Cytarabine, Female, Homoharringtonine, Humans, Idarubicin, Induction Chemotherapy, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Middle Aged, Treatment Outcome",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ChiCTR', 'AccessionNumberList': ['ChiCTR-OPC-15006085']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase II', attributes={'UI': 'D017427'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ChiCTR,ChiCTR-OPC-15006085,,,,,,,,,,

A phase 1/2 study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and antileukemic activity of uproleselan (5-20 mg/kg) with MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine) among patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Among the first 19 patients, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) was 10 mg/kg twice daily. An additional 47 patients with R/R AML were treated with uproleselan at the RP2D plus MEC. At the RP2D, the remission rate (complete response [CR]/CR with incomplete count recovery [CRi]) was 41% (CR, 35%), and the median overall survival (OS) was 8.8 months. In a separate cohort, 25 newly diagnosed patients age ≥60 years received uproleselan at the RP2D plus cytarabine and idarubicin (7 + 3). In these frontline patients, the CR/CRi rate was 72% (CR, 52%), and the median OS was 12.6 months. The addition of uproleselan was associated with low rates of oral mucositis. E-selectin ligand expression on leukemic blasts was higher in patients with relapsed vs primary refractory AML and in newly diagnosed older patients with high-risk cytogenetics and secondary AML. In the R/R cohort, E-selectin expression >10% was associated with a higher response rate and improved survival. The addition of uproleselan to chemotherapy was well tolerated, with high remission rates, low induction mortality, and low rates of mucositis, providing a strong rationale for phase 3 randomized confirmatory studies.

CC-90002 is unique among previously reported anti-CD47 bivalent antibodies that it does not promote hemagglutination while maintaining high-affinity binding to CD47 and inhibition of the CD47-SIRPα interaction. Studies in a panel of hematological cancer cell lines showed concentration-dependent CC-90002-mediated phagocytosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), lenalidomide-resistant multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines and AML cells from patients. In vivo studies with MM cell line-derived xenograft models established in immunodeficient mice demonstrated significant dose-dependent antitumor activity of CC-90002. Treatment with CC-90002 significantly prolonged survival in an HL-60-disseminated AML model. Mechanistic studies confirmed the binding of CC-90002 to tumor cells and concomitant recruitment of F4-80 positive macrophages into the tumor and an increase in expression of select chemokines and cytokines of murine origin. Furthermore, the role of macrophages in the CC-90002-mediated antitumor activity was demonstrated by transient depletion of macrophages with liposome-clodronate treatment. In non-human primates, CC-90002 displayed acceptable pharmacokinetic properties and a favorable toxicity profile. These data demonstrate the potential activity of CC-90002 across hematological malignancies and provided basis for clinical studies CC-90002-ST-001 (NCT02367196) and CC-90002-AML-001 (NCT02641002).",Journal Article,"Animals, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Antigens, Differentiation, Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological, Apoptosis, CD47 Antigen, Cell Differentiation, Cell Proliferation, Female, Humans, Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Macrophages, Mice, Mice, Inbred NOD, Mice, SCID, Phagocytosis, Prognosis, Receptors, Immunologic, Tumor Cells, Cultured, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays","ListElement([StringElement('AML', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('CC-90002', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('IgG4PE', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Macrophages', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Multiple myeloma', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Phagocytosis', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT02367196', 'NCT02641002']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02367196,"A Phase 1, Dose Finding Study of CC-90002 in Subjects With Advanced Solid and Hematologic Cancers","A Phase I, Open-Label, Dose Finding Study of CC-90002, a Monoclonal Antibody Directed Against CD47, in Subjects With Advanced Solid and Hematologic Cancers","CC-90002-ST -001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation clinical study in subjects with advanced, refractory solid and hematologic cancers.",2015-03-12,2020-12-24,PHASE1,60,"**Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)**

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as daunorubicin, cytarabine, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. CPX-351 is made up of daunorubicin and cytarabine and is made in a way that makes the drugs stay in the bone marrow longer and could be less likely to cause heart problems than traditional anthracycline drugs, a common class of chemotherapy drug. Some acute myeloid leukemia patients have an abnormality in the structure of a gene called FLT3. Genes are pieces of DNA (molecules that carry instructions for development, functioning, growth and reproduction) inside each cell that tell the cell what to do and when to grow and divide. FLT3 plays an important role in the normal making of blood cells. This gene can have permanent changes that cause it to function abnormally by making cancer cells grow. Gilteritinib may block the abnormal function of the FLT3 gene that makes cancer cells grow. The overall goals of this study are, 1) to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of CPX-351 with daunorubicin and cytarabine on people with newly diagnosed AML to find out which is better, 2) to study the effects, good and/or bad, of adding gilteritinib to AML therapy for patients with high amounts of FLT3/ITD or other FLT3 mutations and 3) to study changes in heart function during and after treatment for AML. Giving CPX-351 and/or gilteritinib with standard chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia compared to standard chemotherapy alone.",2020-07-21,2027-09-30,PHASE3,1186,"**Event-free survival (EFS)**
