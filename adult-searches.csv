NCT05330364,Study of Chidamide Combined With Cladribine in Refractory/Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05330364,UNKNOWN,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is highly heterogeneous, the efficacy of the individual varies greatly, and the risk of recurrence is high. A large number of newly diagnosed AML patients cannot achieve complete remission (CR) after standard induction chemotherapy. The prognosis of AML patients after relapse is extremely poor, and only a few patients can get remission through salvage treatment.

Chidamide is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) independently developed by China. It has been marketed in recent years and the first innovative drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for clinical research in the United States. Chidamide can increase the sensitivity of leukemia cells to conventional chemotherapy by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and increasing cell cycle arrest. Chidamide and other drugs have different effects in combination, and jointly bear the anti-tumor effect, which provides a theoretical basis for Chidamide in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.

Cladribine is a purine nucleoside analog, which has the ability to inhibit DNA synthesis, repair, induce apoptosis, and has anti-leukemia activity for cells in both mitotic and quiescent phases. In the past ten years, many studies have proved that Cladribine and its combination therapy are effective in patients with relapsed and refractory AML and de novo AML. The NCCN guidelines recommend the combination of cladribine as a category 1 recommendation for newly-diagnosed and refractory or relapsed adult AML. Several studies have confirmed the use of Cladribine in the treatment of refractory and relapsed AML.

The strong synergistic anti-cancer effect of HDACi combined with Cladribine has been shown in many cancers such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colon cancer, multiple myeloma, natural killer large granular lymphocytic leukemia, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma. Our previous study found a synergistic effect on combination of Chidamide and Cladribine in AML cell lines and primary cells. In clinical observation, refractory and relapsed AML patients also responded well to the combination of Chidamide plus Cladribine regimen. This provides a theoretical and practical basis for the use of the combination of Chidamide and Cladribine in AML patients.",NO,Acute Myeloid Leukemia,DRUG: Chidamide|DRUG: Cladribine,"Complete Remission (CR) rate, Less than 5 percent of blast cells in bone marrow aspiration is defined as CR., Bone marrow examination will be performed at the end of Cycle 1 (each cycle is 28 days)","Incidences of Adverse Events (AEs), Safety and Tolerability, All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until 30 days after discontinuation of study drug administration will be collected.|Overall Survival (OS), The overall survival evaluation, OS is defined as the number of days from the date of the study enrollment to the date of death of any cause with a minimal 12 months of follow up.

However, most patients have poor outcomes following the currently first-line DA(daunorubicin, cytarabine)/IA(Idarubicin, cytarabine) chemotherapy, espiecially for the older patients and those not eligiable for receiving allo-HSCT. Azacitidine (AZA)，a hypomethylating agent, targets epigenetic gene silencing by inhibiting gene expression against malignant phenotypes and is currently approved to treat AML based on the NCCN guidelines. The homoharringtonie (HHT) could induce AML cell lines and primary myeloid leukemia cell apoptosis, and the effect was dose dependent. While, HHT could also induce leukemia cells to differentiate into normal state, eventually achieve the goal of treatment, and control the disease.

Subjects will be pretreated with chemotherapy prior to infusion of CAR T cells: about 5 days before cells transfusion, the patients who planned to reinfuse CAR T cells were treated with fluorodarabine 30 mg/m\^2( body surface area) and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m\^2( body surface area) for 3 days. Then the Bayesian optimal interval phase I/II (Boin12) trial design will be used in this study: The protocol preset 2 dose levels: Dose 1 (DL-1) was 5×10\^5 (±20%) CAR T cells/kg, and dose 2 (DL-2) was 1×10\^6 (±20%) CAR T cells/kg.

NCT03796533,Pharmacokinetics Variability of Posaconazole (PCZ) and Its Glucuronide Metabolite During Induction and Consolidation Treatments in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): a Covariate Analysis With the Tablets Formulation and Evaluation of the Potential Risk of Hepatotoxicity,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03796533,UNKNOWN,"Among its authorized indications, posaconazole (PCZ) is prescribed for prophylaxis in onco-hematology patients at high risk of invasive fungal infections. This azole antifungal has a low bioavailability. The enteric-coated tablets form available since mid-2015 has significantly improved its pharmacokinetic profile compared to the oral suspension form initially used. According to the recommendations of The European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL-6), the minimum serum concentration desirable for prophylaxis is 0.7 mg/L. This concentration threshold was difficult to achieve in onco-hematology patients treated with oral suspension.

The investigators retrospectively collected and analyzed 201 results of residual PCZ serum concentrations from 91 onco-hematology patients on Noxafil® tablets prophylaxis. The median concentration of PCZ was 1.08 mg/L. In this study, the pharmacokinetics of tablet-PCZ showed significant inter-individual variability. Thus, while 25% of the concentrations remained below the recommended threshold of 0.7 mg/L (25% percentile = 0.69 mg/L), exposure to PCZ was greater than 2.63 mg/L in 10% of cases. This level of exposure, however, did not have obvious hepatic repercussions. Nevertheless, further studies involving larger cohorts are needed to clarify a hypothetical relationship between serum PCZ concentration and the occurrence of hepatic toxicity.

In addition, the investigators found significant intra-individual variability in PCZ exposure (CV = 48.8%), especially in leukemic patients. This variability is probably related to a modification during the treatment of the physio-pathological conditions of the patient likely to impact the pharmacokinetics of PCZ (absorption, distribution, metabolism, etc.) as well as the effect of possible pharmacokinetic drug interactions.

The metabolism of PCZ is mediated primarily by the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferase 1A4 (UGT1A4) pathway. Although hepatic metabolism of PCZ is low compared with other azoles (such as itraconazole or voriconazole), differences in the metabolic capacity of UGT1A4 may alter PCZ exposure. A previous study of the oral suspension form had shown that low concentrations of PCZ were associated with a high ratio of PCZ-glucuronide / PCZ concentrations. Two genetic variants of the gene encoding UGT1A4 are associated with a decrease in the metabolic clearance of glucuronide drugs via UGT1A4. A recent study suggests less exposure to PCZ in the presence of UGT1A4 polymorphism.

The main objective of the investigator's project is to study prospectively in a homogeneous population of patients treated by intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (induction and consolidation) the pharmacokinetics of PCZ administered in its tablet formulation, and in particular:

* Clinical and biological tolerance of high concentrations of PCZ
* The influence of clinical and demographic covariates on PCZ and PCZ-glucuronide ratio
* The influence of genetic variants of UGT1A4 on PCZ metabolism (PCZ-glucuronide / PCZ ratio).",NO,"Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute",DRUG: Posaconazole,"Evolution of the blood concentration of posaconazole and its metabolite from the beginning of treatment to the end of the induction phase (pharmacokinetic)., Posaconazole (PCZ) treatment will start at Day 1 at the beginning of induction/ consolidation therapy.

NCT04219163,Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells for the Treatment of AML Expressing CLL-1 Antigen,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04219163,RECRUITING,"Patients eligible for this study have a type of blood cancer Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) which has come back or has not gone away after treatment.

The body has different ways of fighting disease and infection, and this research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer with antibodies and T cells with the hope that they will work together. T cells (also called T lymphocytes) are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells including tumor cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from bacterial and other infectious diseases. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients when used alone.

T lymphocytes can kill tumor cells but there normally are not enough of them to kill all the tumor cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the person. The antibody used in this study targets CLL-1. This antibody sticks to AML cells because of a substance (protein) on the outside of these cells called CLL-1. For this study, the antibody to CLL-1 has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood, it is now joined to the T cells. When T-cells contain an antibody that is joined to them, they are called chimeric antigen receptor T-cells or CAR-T cells.

In the laboratory, the investigators have also found that T cells work better if proteins that stimulate T cells are also added, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the cells grow better and last longer in the body, thus giving the cells a better chance of killing the leukemia or lymphoma cells. In this study we are going to attach the CLL-1 chimeric receptor that has CD28 added to it to the patient's T cells. We will then test how long the cells last.

NCT04293562,A Study to Compare Standard Chemotherapy to Therapy With CPX-351 and/or Gilteritinib for Patients With Newly Diagnosed AML With or Without FLT3 Mutations,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04293562,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This phase III trial compares standard chemotherapy to therapy with liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) and/or gilteritinib for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia with or without FLT3 mutations. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as daunorubicin, cytarabine, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. CPX-351 is made up of daunorubicin and cytarabine and is made in a way that makes the drugs stay in the bone marrow longer and could be less likely to cause heart problems than traditional anthracycline drugs, a common class of chemotherapy drug. Some acute myeloid leukemia patients have an abnormality in the structure of a gene called FLT3. Genes are pieces of DNA (molecules that carry instructions for development, functioning, growth and reproduction) inside each cell that tell the cell what to do and when to grow and divide. FLT3 plays an important role in the normal making of blood cells. This gene can have permanent changes that cause it to function abnormally by making cancer cells grow. Gilteritinib may block the abnormal function of the FLT3 gene that makes cancer cells grow. The overall goals of this study are, 1) to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of CPX-351 with daunorubicin and cytarabine on people with newly diagnosed AML to find out which is better, 2) to study the effects, good and/or bad, of adding gilteritinib to AML therapy for patients with high amounts of FLT3/ITD or other FLT3 mutations and 3) to study changes in heart function during and after treatment for AML. Giving CPX-351 and/or gilteritinib with standard chemotherapy may work better in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia compared to standard chemotherapy alone.",NO,Acute Myeloid Leukemia,PROCEDURE: Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|DRUG: Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Aspiration|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Daunorubicin Hydrochloride|DRUG: Dexrazoxane Hydrochloride|DRUG: Etoposide|OTHER: Fludeoxyglucose F-18|DRUG: Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin|DRUG: Gilteritinib Fumarate|DRUG: Liposome-encapsulated Daunorubicin-Cytarabine|PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|DRUG: Methotrexate|DRUG: Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography|OTHER: Questionnaire Administration|DRUG: Therapeutic Hydrocortisone,"Event-free survival (EFS), The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate 3-year EFS, defined as the time from study entry until induction failure, relapse, secondary malignancy, or death., Up to 3 years","Overall survival (OS), The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate 3-year OS, defined as the time from study entry until death., Up to 3 years|Proportion of patients positive for minimal residual disease (MRD+), The proportion of patients MRD+ at end of induction 1 (EOI1) will be estimated as the number of patients MRD+ divided by the number of patients with evaluable EOI1 MRD results along with a corresponding 95% confidence interval determined using a binomial exact method., Up to 4 weeks|Proportion of patients who died during protocol therapy, The proportion of patients who died during protocol therapy will be estimated along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval determined using a binomial exact method., Up to 2 years|Incidence of adverse events, The proportion of patients experiencing at least one grade 3 or higher non-hematologic toxicity and infection while on protocol therapy will be estimated along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval determined using a binomial exact method.

This study involves testing patients' bone marrow and blood for certain biomarkers. A biomarker (sometimes called a marker) is any molecule in the body that can be measured. Doctors look at markers to learn what is happening in the body. Knowing about certain markers can give doctors more information about what is driving the cancer and how to treat it. Testing patients' bone marrow and blood will show doctors if patients have markers that specific drugs can target. The marker testing in this study will let doctors know if they can match patients with a treatment study (myeloMATCH clinical trial) that tests treatment for the type of cancer they have or continue standard of care treatment with their doctor on the Tier Advancement Pathway (TAP).,NO,Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Myelodysplastic Syndrome,DRUG: Azacitidine|OTHER: Best Practice|PROCEDURE: Biopsy|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Aspiration|PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Biopsy|DRUG: Cytarabine|DRUG: Daunorubicin Hydrochloride|DRUG: Decitabine and Cedazuridine|PROCEDURE: Echocardiography|DRUG: Enasidenib|DRUG: Gilteritinib|DRUG: Liposome-encapsulated Daunorubicin-Cytarabine|PROCEDURE: Multigated Acquisition Scan|PROCEDURE: Mutation Carrier Screening|DRUG: Venetoclax,"Timing of treatment Substudy or Tier Advancement Pathway (TAP) assignment, Will evaluate the feasibility of MATCHBox generating all data needed for assignment to a myeloMATCH clinical trial or determination that no assignment is available, within 72 hours of MDNet receipt of specimens for initial therapy and within 10 days for subsequent therapy.

The expressions of PD-1 and PD-L1 are increased in AML cells. However, blocking the immune checkpoint alone has limited efficacy as a single agent in highly proliferative leukemia cells.

NCT05444348,Compassionate Communication and Advance Care Planning to Improve End of Life Care in Treatment of Hematological Disease (ACT),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05444348,RECRUITING,"Patients diagnosed with hematologic cancer are at substantial risk of dying, as 5-year survival among patients with acute myeloid leukemia is 20 % and only every second patient treated for incurable myeloma lives 5 years after date of diagnosis. Nevertheless, many overestimate their prognosis, and value of therapy. Patients with hematological cancers frequently have poor end of life outcomes, such as high treatment activity close to death, where clinical effects are doubtful, and low utilization of palliative care. Prognostic awareness and end of life (EOL) issues have urgency in the communication between patients, their caregiving relatives, and clinicians, in order to avoid futile treatments and suffering at EOL. Inspired by advanced care planning, the investigators developed the concept ""Advance Consultations Concerning participants Life and Treatment"" (ACT) in collaboration with a group consisting of hematologists, nurses, patients, and caregivers. The ACT concept consists of an 8-hour training day for clinicians, clinical tools, system changes, and preparation material for patients and caregivers prior to the consultation. ACT involves patients and caregivers earlier in preparation for life with chronic progressive disease and EOL-decisions, through an intervention based on compassionate communication and early planning of EOL-care. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of the intervention on use of chemotherapy and quality of EOL-care in patients with hematological malignancy. Based on the results of the completed pilot study, the investigators are planning a nationwide 2-arm cluster randomized controlled trial where 40 physicians and 80 nurses across seven different hematological departments are randomized to either usual care or ACT training and completing ACT conversations. The investigators expect to include a total of 400 patients and their family caregivers.

This study focuses on two types of cancers: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). AML (blood cancer) is cancer of the white blood cells (WBC). NSCLC (solid tumor) is a disease in which cancer cells form in the tissues of the lung. The purpose of this study is to determine recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and to see if the study drug is safe and able to treat patients who have AML and NSCLC.

ABBV-184 is an investigational drug being developed for treatment of cancer. The study has two arms and two phases: AML arm and NSCLC arm; dose escalation and dose expansion phase. Adult participants with diagnosis of AML or NSCLC will be enrolled. In dose escalation phase, around 36 participants will be enrolled in each arm. In dose expansion phase, around 20 participants will be enrolled in each arm. The study will be conducted in approximately 50 sites across 10 countries.

Participants will receive weight based intravenous (IV) infusion of ABBV-184 once a week. At the beginning of the study, visits will occur daily during hospitalization followed by less frequently over time.

The clinical trial is divided into pre-treatment, treatment (induction and consolidation cycles) and follow-up periods and consists of a single arm group. Patients will be enrolled at diagnosis to follow the treatment arm. After that will start induction chemotherapy with CPX-351 regimen (14 days maximum screening period). Once a patient have been evaluated for response and recovered from major complications, he/she will start second course (consolidation 1), unless the bone marrow and peripheral blood assessment is showing less than a complete response, then a second induction may be offered. If a CR or CRi is obtained after the second induction course, patients will start the third course after a rest and recovery period. Patients aged between 60 and 65 years old are recommended to undergo an allo-SCT after first consolidation if they are considered fit for this procedure and they have a full matched related or unrelated donor. Patients aged between 65 and 70 years old can be proposed for an allo-SCT in CR/CRi if they have a composite HSCT co-morbidity index /age less than 4 and a suitable fully matched related donor. In patients over 70 years old, an allo-SCT in first CR should be avoided although the decision should be taken on an individual basis.

NCT04052126,An Individualized Physical Activity Program in Patients Over 65 Years With Hematologic Malignancies,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04052126,COMPLETED,"Older people with cancer differ from younger patients due to the combined effects of aging, comorbidities and cancer treatments on their health. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chemotherapy, which is the main treatment, is associated with significant toxicity that negatively affects patients' physical capacities and quality of life, already declining with age and comorbidities. It therefore seems essential to develop and evaluate interventions that can prevent physical and psychosocial decline and its consequences in these populations. However, no studies have evaluated a physical activity (PA) program among these populations, although the absence of risk of implementing PA during intense therapeutic procedures has been confirmed.

OCAPI is an interdisciplinary, prospective, interventional, feasibility study. It is intended to include 20 AML and 20 NHL patients 65 years of age or older at the time of initiation of the first chemotherapy line, with an ECOG \<3, with no contraindications to PA and no history or coexistence of other primary cancer.

Expected results are to demonstrate that a program offering supervised sessions in a sterile room or at home and remote support can enable patients with AML or NHL to perform their daily PA in autonomy.

NCT03854318,Longitudinal Studies of Patient With FPDMM,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03854318,RECRUITING,"Background:

Genes tell the body and its cells how to work. Familial platelet disease (FPD) or FPD with associated malignancies (FPDMM) is caused by a variant in the gene RUNX1. People with this disease may have problems with their blood and bleed for a long time when they are injured. Researchers want to learn more about RUNX1 variants and FPD.

Objective:

To learn more about FPD in people with RUNX1 variants to lead to better diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment.

Eligibility:

People any age with a suspected or confirmed RUNX1 variant

People who have a family member with the variant

Design:

All participants will be screened with a phone call and a blood, saliva, or cheek cell sample.

Participants with a suspected or confirmed variant will have 1 visit. It will last about 2 days. They will then have visits at least once a year.

Visits will include:

* Medical history and physical exam
* Blood tests or saliva sample
* Possible skin biopsy: A small piece of the participant s skin will be removed.
* Bone marrow aspiration or biopsy: The participant s bone marrow will be removed by needle from a large bone such as the hip bone.
* Possible apheresis: Blood will be removed from the body and certain blood cells will be taken out. The rest of the blood is returned to the body.

Between visits, participants with a suspected or confirmed variant will keep a diary of disease symptoms and signs.

Samples from all participants may be used for genetic testing",NO,Inherited Hematological Diseases|Rare Diseases|FPDMM,,"Natural History, This protocol continues the decades-long tradition of identifying and examining patients with rare genetic diseases and characterizing the natural history., Ongoing",,,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2019-03-28,2028-12-31,2028-12-31,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",3
