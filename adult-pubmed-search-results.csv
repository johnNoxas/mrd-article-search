34065859,Unmasking BCL-2 Addiction in Synovial Sarcoma by Overcoming Low NOXA.,"Fairchild Carter K, Floros Konstantinos V, Jacob Sheeba, Coon Colin M, Puchalapalli Madhavi, Hu Bin, Harada Hisashi, Dozmorov Mikhail G, Koblinski Jennifer E, Smith Steven C, Domson Gregory, Leverson Joel D, Souers Andrew J, Takebe Naoko, Ebi Hiromichi, Faber Anthony C, Boikos Sosipatros A",Cancers,"{'Year': '2021', 'Month': 'May', 'Day': '12'}","Synovial sarcoma (SS) is frequently diagnosed in teenagers and young adults and continues to be treated with polychemotherapy with variable success. The SS18-SSX gene fusion is pathognomonic for the disease, and high expression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 pathologically supports the diagnosis. As the oncogenic SS18-SSX fusion gene itself is not druggable, BCL-2 inhibitor-based therapies are an appealing therapeutic opportunity. Venetoclax, an FDA-approved BCL-2 inhibitor that is revolutionizing care in some BCL-2-expressing hematological cancers, affords an intriguing therapeutic possibility to treat SS. In addition, there are now dozens of venetoclax-based combination therapies in clinical trials in hematological cancers, attributing to the limited toxicity of venetoclax. However, preclinical studies of venetoclax in SS have demonstrated an unexpected ineffectiveness. In this study, we analyzed the response of SS to venetoclax and the underlying BCL-2 family biology in an effort to understand venetoclax treatment failure and find a therapeutic strategy to sensitize SS to venetoclax. We found remarkably depressed levels of the endogenous MCL-1 inhibitor, NOXA, in SS compared to other sarcomas. Expressing NOXA led to sensitization to venetoclax, as did the addition of the MCL-1 BH3 mimetic, S63845. Importantly, the venetoclax/S63845 combination induced tumor regressions in SS patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. As a very close analog of S63845 (S64315) is now in clinical trials with venetoclax in AML (NCT03672695), the combination of MCL-1 BH3 mimetics and venetoclax should be considered for SS patients as a new therapy.",Journal Article,

However, primary or secondary resistance to azacitidine/venetoclax is an area of unmet need and overexpression of MCL1 is suggested to be a potential resistance mechanism. Pevonedistat inhibits MCL1 through activation of NOXA, and pevonedistat/azacitidine has previously shown activity in AML. To assess the tolerability and efficacy of adding pevonedistat to azacitidine/ venetoclax in relapsed/refractory AML, we conducted a phase I, multicenter, open-label study in 16 adults with relapsed/ refractory AML. Patients were treated with azacitidine, venetoclax along with pevonedistat intravenously on days 1, 3 and 5 of each 28-day cycle at doses of 10, 15 or 20 mg/m2 in successive cohorts in the dose escalation phase. The impact of treatment on protein neddylation as well as expression of pro-apoptotic BCL2 family members was assessed. The recommended phase II dose of pevonedistat was 20 mg/m2. Grade 3 or higher adverse events included neutropenia (31%), thrombocytopenia (13%), febrile neutropenia (19%), anemia (19%), hypertension (19%) and sepsis (19%). The overall response rate was 46.7% for the whole cohort including complete remission in five of seven (71.4%) patients who had not previously been treated with the hypomethylating agent/venetoclax. No measurable residual disease was detected in 80.0% of the patients who achieved complete remission. The median time to best response was 50 (range, 23-77) days. Four patients were bridged to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The combination of azacitidine, venetoclax and pevonedistat is safe and shows encouraging preliminary activity in patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

Overall, s/tAML patients had similar cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), but higher non-relapse mortality (NRM) and shorter overall survival (OS). In multivariate analyses, after adjustment for ELN risk and pre-HSCT measurable residual disease status, disease origin did not impact outcomes. Within the ELN favorable risk group, CIR was higher in s/tAML compared to de novo AML patients likely due to a different distribution of genetic aberrations, which did not translate into shorter OS. Within the ELN intermediate and adverse group outcomes were similar in de novo and s/tAML patients. Thus, not all s/tAML have a dismal prognosis and outcomes of s/tAML after allogeneic HSCT in remission are comparable to de novo patients when considering ELN risk.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Aged, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Prognosis, Risk Assessment, Transplantation, Homologous"

Median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 4 (range, 3-8) and four patients received CAR T-cells 8-18 months post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) of any grade occurred in all patients, and 1 patient had grade 3 CRS. Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) occurred in 2 patients at low grades. Tocilizumab was administered to 2 patients and corticosteroids to 3 patients. Four patients achieved a complete remission (CR), while 2/6 progressed (PD). Three patients (2 with CR and 1 with PD) underwent allo-HSCT (it was the second transplant in 2) 2-5 months post CAR T-cells infusion. The median duration of response in patients achieving CR was 8.5 (range; 3-14) months. However, all patients eventually died within 5 (1-18) months. In conclusion, CD19 CAR T- cell treatment for AML is feasible and safe. However, the response is short and should be followed by allo-HSCT.

Patients and methods Healthy donor mononuclear cells collected by leukapheresis were consistently expanded to generate products of 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> γδ T cells. Seven patients received donor-derived T cell product at doses of 10<sup>6</sup>/kg (n = 3), 10<sup>7</sup>/kg (n = 3), and 10<sup>8</sup>/kg (n = 1). Results Four patients had bone marrow evaluation at day 28. One patient had a complete remission, one was classified as morphologic leukemia-free state, one had stable disease and one had no evidence of response. In one patient, there was evidence of disease control with repeat infusions up to 100 days after first dosing. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events or treatment-related Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 or greater toxicities at any dose level. Allogeneic Vγ9Vδ2 T cell infusion was shown to be safe and feasible up to a cell dose of 10<sup>8</sup>/kg. Discussion In agreement with previously published studies, the infusion of allogeneic Vγ9Vδ2 cells was safe. The contribution of lymphodepleting chemotherapy to responses seen cannot be ruled out. Main limitation of the study is the low number of patients and interruption due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Evaluating drug schedules aims at improving treatment safety while maintaining efficacy. However, while we can reasonably assume that toxicity increases with the dose for cytotoxic drugs, the relationship between toxicity and multiple schedules remains elusive. We proposed a Bayesian dose regimen assessment method (DRtox) using pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) to estimate the maximum tolerated dose regimen (MTD-regimen) at the end of the dose-escalation stage of a trial. We modeled the binary toxicity via a PD endpoint and estimated the dose regimen toxicity relationship through the integration of a dose regimen PD model and a PD toxicity model. For the first model, we considered nonlinear mixed-effects models, and for the second one, we proposed the following two Bayesian approaches: a logistic model and a hierarchical model. In an extensive simulation study, the DRtox outperformed traditional designs in terms of proportion of correctly selecting the MTD-regimen. Moreover, the inclusion of PK/PD information helped provide more precise estimates for the entire dose regimen toxicity curve; therefore the DRtox may recommend alternative untested regimens for expansion cohorts. The DRtox was developed to be applied at the end of the dose-escalation stage of an ongoing trial for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (NCT03594955) once all toxicity and PK/PD data are collected.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Antineoplastic Agents, Bayes Theorem, Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Humans, Longitudinal Studies, Maximum Tolerated Dose"

However, clinical outcomes are unsatisfied for patients with intermediate/adverse cytogenetics based on European Leukemia Net (ELN) risk stratification 2022 (ELN 2022), and relapses also remain common even in patients with favorable-risk cytogenetics with measurable residual disease (MRD). There is an urgent unmet need for optimizing intensive chemotherapy regimens with novel agents, to enhance the MRD-negative rate, achieve durable remission, and improve the prognosis of AML.

MDM2 inhibitor (MDM2i) monotherapy in AML has shown modest responses in clinical trials but combining options of MDM2i with other potent AML-directed agents like cytarabine and venetoclax could improve its efficacy. We conducted a phase I clinical trial (NCT03634228) to study the safety and efficacy of milademetan (an MDM2i) with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC)±venetoclax in adult patients with relapsed refractory (R/R) or newly diagnosed (ND; unfit) TP53 wild-type AML and performed comprehensive CyTOF analyses to interrogate multiple signaling pathways, the p53-MDM2 axis and the interplay between pro/anti-apoptotic molecules to identify factors that determine response and resistance to therapy.

Here, we present the identification of a first-in-class GSPT1-selective cereblon E3 ligase modulator, CC-90009. Biochemical, structural, and molecular characterization demonstrates that CC-90009 coopts the CRL4CRBN to selectively target GSPT1 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Depletion of GSPT1 by CC-90009 rapidly induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) apoptosis, reducing leukemia engraftment and leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in large-scale primary patient xenografting of 35 independent AML samples, including those with adverse risk features. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen for effectors of CC-90009 response, we uncovered the ILF2 and ILF3 heterodimeric complex as a novel regulator of cereblon expression. Knockout of ILF2/ILF3 decreases the production of full-length cereblon protein via modulating CRBN messenger RNA alternative splicing, leading to diminished response to CC-90009. The screen also revealed that the mTOR signaling and the integrated stress response specifically regulate the response to CC-90009 in contrast to other cereblon modulators. Hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway by inactivation of TSC1 and TSC2 protected against the growth inhibitory effect of CC-90009 by reducing CC-90009-induced binding of GSPT1 to cereblon and subsequent GSPT1 degradation. On the other hand, GSPT1 degradation promoted the activation of the GCN1/GCN2/ATF4 pathway and subsequent apoptosis in AML cells. Collectively, CC-90009 activity is mediated by multiple layers of signaling networks and pathways within AML blasts and LSCs, whose elucidation gives insight into further assessment of CC-90009s clinical utility.

We identified leukemic stem cells (LSC) as primary targets of 5-AZA/VEN whose elimination determined the therapy outcome.

These defects are caused in part by the high expression of CD155 by AML. Overexpressing C-JUN, but not other antigen receptor downstream components, maximally restores anti-tumor function.

CC-96191 was broadly active against human leukemia cells in a strictly CD33-dependent manner, with maximal efficacy requiring the co-engagement of CD16a and NKG2D. A frequent CD33 single nucleotide polymorphism, R69G, reduced CC-96191 potency but not maximal activity, likely because of reduced CD33 binding. Similarly, the potency, but not the maximal activity, of CC-96191 was reduced by high concentrations of soluble CD33; in contrast, the soluble form of the NKG2D ligand MICA did not impact activity. In the presence of CD33+ AML cells, CC-96191 activated NK cells but not T cells; while maximum anti-AML efficacy was similar, soluble cytokine levels were 10- to >100-fold lower than with a CD33/CD3 bispecific antibody. While CC-96191-mediated cytolysis was not affected by ABC transporter proteins, it was reduced by anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins.

However, classical antibody-based approaches are restricted to targeting lineage-specific cell surface antigens. By targeting intracellular antigens, a large number of other leukemia-associated targets would become accessible. In this study, we evaluated a novel T-cell bispecific (TCB) antibody, generated by using CrossMAb and knob-into-holes technology, containing a bivalent T-cell receptor-like binding domain that recognizes the RMFPNAPYL peptide derived from the intracellular tumor antigen Wilms tumor protein (WT1) in the context of HLA-A*02. Binding to CD3ε recruits T cells irrespective of their T-cell receptor specificity. WT1-TCB elicited antibody-mediated T-cell cytotoxicity against AML cell lines in a WT1- and HLA-restricted manner. Specific lysis of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells was mediated in ex vivo long-term cocultures by using allogeneic (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM] specific lysis, 67 ± 6% after 13-14 days; n = 18) or autologous, patient-derived T cells (mean ± SEM specific lysis, 54 ± 12% after 11-14 days; n = 8). WT1-TCB-treated T cells exhibited higher cytotoxicity against primary AML cells than an HLA-A*02 RMF-specific T-cell clone. Combining WT1-TCB with the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide further enhanced antibody-mediated T-cell cytotoxicity against primary AML cells (mean ± SEM specific lysis on days 3-4, 45.4 ± 9.0% vs 70.8 ± 8.3%; P = .015; n = 9-10). In vivo, WT1-TCB-treated humanized mice bearing SKM-1 tumors exhibited a significant and dose-dependent reduction in tumor growth. In summary, we show that WT1-TCB facilitates potent in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo killing of AML cell lines and primary AML cells; these results led to the initiation of a phase 1 trial in patients with relapsed/refractory AML (#NCT04580121).","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Antibodies, Bispecific, Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological, Cell Line, Tumor, HLA-A2 Antigen, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Peptides, Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic, Tumor Cells, Cultured, WT1 Proteins"

Venetoclax sensitivity was successfully assessed in 102 of 104 participants, with results available within a median of 3 days from sampling. In previously untreated AML, ex vivo sensitivity corresponded to an 85% (34/40) CR/CRi rate, with a median overall survival (OS) of 28.7 months, compared with 5.5 months for ex vivo resistant patients (P = .002).

Early left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) compromises anthracycline delivery and is associated with inferior event-free and overall survival in <i>de novo</i> pediatric AML. Thus, effective cardioprotective strategies and cardiotoxicity risk predictors are critical to optimize cancer therapy delivery and enable early interventions to prevent progressive LVSD. While dexrazoxane-based cardioprotection reduces short-term cardiotoxicity without compromising cancer survival, liposomal anthracycline formulations have the potential to mitigate cardiotoxicity while improving antitumor efficacy.

The disease is driven by leukemic stem cells (LSCs), which are characterized by clonal heterogeneity and resistance to conventional therapy. These cells are therefore believed to be a major cause of progression and relapse. We designed MP0533, a multispecific CD3-engaging designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) that can simultaneously bind to three antigens on AML cells (CD33, CD123, and CD70), aiming to enable avidity-driven T cell-mediated killing of AML cells coexpressing at least two of the antigens. In vitro, MP0533 induced selective T cell-mediated killing of AML cell lines, as well as patient-derived AML blasts and LSCs, expressing two or more target antigens, while sparing healthy HSCs, blood, and endothelial cells. The higher selectivity also resulted in markedly lower levels of cytokine release in normal human blood compared to single antigen-targeting T-cell engagers. In xenograft AML mice models, MP0533 induced tumor-localized T-cell activation and cytokine release, leading to complete eradication of the tumors while having no systemic adverse effects. These studies show that the multispecific-targeting strategy used with MP0533 holds promise for improved selectivity toward LSCs and efficacy against clonal heterogeneity, potentially bringing a new therapeutic option to this group of patients with a high unmet need.

Thus, CAR-T lacking fine-tuned control mechanisms pose a high toxicity risk.

Further, 54% (21/39) of primary T-ALL patient samples were sensitive to MERTK inhibition. Treatment with MRX-2843 significantly reduced leukemia burden and prolonged survival in cell-line-derived T-ALL and ETP-ALL xenograft models. In a patient-derived ETP-ALL xenograft model, treatment with MRX-2843 markedly reduced peripheral blood leukemia and spleen weight compared to vehicle-treated mice and prolonged survival. MRX-2843 also synergized with venetoclax to provide enhanced anti-leukemia activity in ETP-ALL cell cultures, with a dose ratio of 1:20 MRX-2843:venetoclax providing optimal synergy. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of MRX-2843 in patients with T-ALL and provide rationale for clinical development. MRX-2843 monotherapy is currently being tested in patients with relapsed leukemia (NCT04872478). Further, our data indicate that combined MERTK and BCL-2 inhibition may be particularly effective for treatment of ETP-ALL.",Journal Article,

Serious illness conversations (SICs) may increase disease understanding and preparations for the future. However, SICs often happen late, in part because of clinician-perceived patient discomfort. Telehealth may promote patient comfort by allowing SICs to take place at home. This study assesses the feasibility and usability of a telehealth-delivered Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) for older adults with AML and MDS. We conducted a single-arm pilot study including 20 older adults with AML and MDS. Feasibility was measured using retention rate, with >80% considered feasible. Usability was measured using telehealth usability questionnaire (TUQ; range, 1-7): >5 considered usable. We collected other outcomes including acceptability and disease understanding and conducted post-visit qualitative interviews to elicit feedback. Hypothesis testing was performed at α = 0.10 owing to the pilot nature and small sample size. Retention rate was 95% (19/20); mean TUQ scores were 5.9 (standard deviation [SD], 0.9) and 5.9 (SD, 1.1) for patients and caregivers, respectively. We found the SICP to be acceptable. The majority of patients found the SICP to be very or extremely worthwhile (88.2%; 15/17), and reported it increased closeness with their clinician (75.0%; 12/16). After their visit, patient estimates of curability, and overall life expectancy aligned more closely with those of their clinicians. In qualitative interviews, most patients said that they would recommend this program to others (89.5%, 17/19). This study demonstrated that delivery of the telehealth SICP to older patients with AML and MDS is feasible, usable, and acceptable.

Early advance care planning may improve care at the end of life for patients with AML or MDS. The Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) is a multicomponent, communication intervention developed to improve conversations about values for patients with serious illnesses. The SICP has been shown to improve the quality and frequency of advance care planning discussions. We adapted the SICP for delivery via telehealth to older patients with AML or MDS. We conducted a single-center qualitative study of 45 participants (25 clinicians, 15 older patients with AML or MDS, and 5 caregivers). Participants, whether clinicians, patients, or caregivers, agreed that the SICP would help older patients with AML or MDS to share their personal values with their care team. Four qualitative themes emerged from our data: (1) serious illness conversations can be conducted via telehealth, (2) older patients have limited experience using technology but are willing and able to learn, (3) patients feel that serious illness conversations will help them understand their AML or MDS diagnosis and prognosis better, and (4) serious illness conversations should be common and routine, not extraordinary. The adapted SICP may provide older patients with AML or MDS an opportunity to share what matters most to them with their care team and may assist oncologists in aligning patient care with patient values. The adapted SICP is the subject of an ongoing single-arm pilot study at the Wilmot Cancer Institute (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04745676).","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans, Critical Care, Pilot Projects, Critical Illness, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Hematologic Neoplasms, Telemedicine"

The IDH2 inhibitor enasidenib was recently approved for IDH2-mutated relapsed or refractory AML. We conducted a multi-center, phase I trial of maintenance enasidenib following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with IDH2-mutated myeloid malignancies. Two dose levels, 50mg and 100mg daily were studied in a 3 × 3 dose-escalation design, with 10 additional patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Enasidenib was initiated between days 30 and 90 following HCT and continued for twelve 28-day cycles. Twenty-three patients were enrolled, of whom 19 initiated post-HCT maintenance. Two had myelodysplastic syndrome, and 17 had AML. All but 3 were in first complete remission. No dose limiting toxicities were observed, and the RP2D was established at 100mg daily. Attributable grade ≥3 toxicities were rare, with the most common being cytopenias. Eight patients stopped maintenance before completing 12 cycles, due to adverse events (n=3), pursuing treatment for graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) (n=2), clinician choice (n=1), relapse (n=1), and COVID infection (n=1). No cases of grade ≥3 acute GVHD were seen, and 12-month cumulative incidence of moderate/severe chronic GVHD was 42% (20-63%). Cumulative incidence of relapse was 16% (95% CI: 3.7-36%); 1 subject relapsed while receiving maintenance. Two-year progression-free and overall survival were 69% (95% CI: 39-86%) and 74% (95% CI, 44-90%), respectively.

A major role in this interaction is played by the affinity of the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) for the antigen, and by the CAR design. In particular, the spacer domain may impact on the CAR T cell function by affecting the length and flexibility of the resulting CAR. This study addresses the need to improve the manufacturing process and the antitumor activity of CD44v6-specific CAR T cells by defining the optimal structure of a spacer region derived from the extracellular domain of the human low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (LNGFR). We tailored the LNGFR spacer to modulate CAR length to efficiently recognize distal or proximal epitopes and to allow selection of transduced CAR T cells by the use of clinical-grade validated manufacturing systems. The different LNGFR spacers investigated in this study are responsible for the generation of CAR T cells with a different memory phenotype, which is mainly related to the level of CAR expression and the extent of the associated tonic signaling.

We evaluated the anti-leukemia efficacy of the novel multi-kinase inhibitor CG-806, which targets FLT3 and other kinases, to circumvent drug resistance and target <i>FLT3</i> wild-type (WT) cells. The anti-leukemia activity of CG-806 was investigated by measuring apoptosis induction and analyzing the cell cycle using flow cytometry <i>in vitro</i>. CG-806 demonstrated superior anti-leukemia efficacy compared to commercially available FLT3 inhibitors, both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, regardless of <i>FLT3</i> mutational status. The mechanism of action of CG-806 may involve its broad inhibitory profile against FLT3, BTK, and AuroK. In <i>FLT3</i> mutant cells, CG-806 induced G1 phase blockage, whereas in <i>FLT3</i> WT cells, it resulted in G2/M phase arrest.

We previously reported that serine biosynthesis is also activated in Ewing sarcoma by the scaffolding protein menin through as yet undefined mechanisms. Here, we investigated whether EWS-FLI1 and/or menin orchestrate serine biosynthesis via modulation of ATF4, a stress-response gene that acts as a master transcriptional regulator of serine biosynthesis in other tumors. Our results show that in Ewing sarcoma, ATF4 levels are high and that ATF4 modulates transcription of core serine synthesis pathway (SSP) genes. Inhibition of either EWS-FLI1 or menin leads to loss of ATF4, and this is associated with diminished expression of SSP transcripts and proteins. We identified and validated an EWS-FLI1 binding site at the <i>ATF4</i> promoter, indicating that the fusion can directly activate ATF4 transcription. In contrast, our results suggest that menin-dependent regulation of ATF4 is mediated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Importantly, our data also reveal that the downregulation of SSP genes that occurs in the context of EWS-FLI1 or menin loss is indicative of broader inhibition of ATF4-dependent transcription. Moreover, we find that menin inhibition similarly leads to loss of ATF4 and the ATF4-dependent transcriptional signature in MLL-rearranged B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, extending our findings to another cancer in which menin serves an oncogenic role. IMPLICATIONS: These studies provide new insights into metabolic reprogramming in Ewing sarcoma and also uncover a previously undescribed role for menin in the regulation of ATF4.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Activating Transcription Factor 4, Biosynthetic Pathways, Bone Neoplasms, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, HEK293 Cells, Humans, Oncogene Proteins, Fusion, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Protein Binding, Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, RNA Interference, RNA-Binding Protein EWS, Sarcoma, Ewing, Serine"

Elderly acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients have been successfully treated with NK cells from HLA-haploidentical donors, especially when high amounts of alloreactive NK cells were infused. The aim of this study was comparing two approaches to define the size of alloreactive NK cells in haploidentical donors for AML patients recruited in two clinical trials with the acronym ""NK-AML"" (NCT03955848), and ""MRD-NK"". The standard methodology was based on the frequency of NK cell clones capable of lysing the related patient-derived cells. The alternative approach consisted of the phenotypic identification of freshly derived NK cells expressing, as inhibitory receptors, only the inhibitory KIR(s) specific for the mismatched KIR-Ligand(s) (HLA-C1, HLA-C2, HLA-Bw4). However, in KIR2DS2<sup>+</sup> donors and HLA-C1<sup>+</sup> patients, the unavailability of reagents staining only the inhibitory counterpart (KIR2DL2/L3) may lead to an underestimated identification of the alloreactive NK cell subset. Conversely, in the case of HLA-C1 mismatch, the alloreactive NK cell subset could be overestimated due to the ability of KIR2DL2/L3 to recognize with low-affinity also HLA-C2. Especially in this context, the additional exclusion of LIR1-expressing cells might be relevant to refine the size of the alloreactive NK cell subset. We could also associate degranulation assays, using as effector cells IL-2 activated donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or NK cells upon co-culture with the related patient target cells. The donor alloreactive NK cell subset always displayed the highest functional activity, confirming its identification accuracy by flow cytometry. Despite the phenotypic limitations and considering the proposed corrective actions, a good correlation was shown by the comparison of the two investigated approaches. In addition, the characterization of receptor expression on a fraction of NK cell clones revealed expected but also few unexpected patterns. Thus, in most instances, the quantification of phenotypically defined alloreactive NK cells from PBMC can provide data similar to the analysis of lytic clones, with several advantages, such as a shorter time to achieve the results and, perhaps, higher reproducibility/feasibility in many laboratories.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Aged, Humans, Donor Selection, Leukocytes, Mononuclear, Immunotherapy, Adoptive, Reproducibility of Results, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Killer Cells, Natural, Clone Cells"

Here, we describe the results of the first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial investigating revumenib (SNDX-5613), a potent and selective oral inhibitor of the menin-KMT2A interaction, in patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukaemia (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04065399). We show that therapy with revumenib was associated with a low frequency of grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events and a 30% rate of complete remission or complete remission with partial haematologic recovery (CR/CRh) in the efficacy analysis population. Asymptomatic prolongation of the QT interval on electrocardiography was identified as the only dose-limiting toxicity. Remissions occurred in leukaemias refractory to multiple previous lines of therapy. We demonstrate clearance of residual disease using sensitive clinical assays and identify hallmarks of differentiation into normal haematopoietic cells, including differentiation syndrome. These data establish menin inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for susceptible acute leukaemia subtypes.","Clinical Trial, Phase I, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Humans, Antineoplastic Agents, Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Neoplasm, Residual, Nucleophosmin, Prognosis, Protein Binding, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, Remission Induction"

We previously reported that serine biosynthesis is also activated in Ewing sarcoma by the scaffolding protein menin through as yet undefined mechanisms. Here, we investigated whether EWS-FLI1 and/or menin orchestrate serine biosynthesis via modulation of ATF4, a stress-response gene that acts as a master transcriptional regulator of serine biosynthesis in other tumors. Our results show that in Ewing sarcoma, ATF4 levels are high and that ATF4 modulates transcription of core serine synthesis pathway (SSP) genes. Inhibition of either EWS-FLI1 or menin leads to loss of ATF4, and this is associated with diminished expression of SSP transcripts and proteins. We identified and validated an EWS-FLI1 binding site at the <i>ATF4</i> promoter, indicating that the fusion can directly activate ATF4 transcription. In contrast, our results suggest that menin-dependent regulation of ATF4 is mediated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Importantly, our data also reveal that the downregulation of SSP genes that occurs in the context of EWS-FLI1 or menin loss is indicative of broader inhibition of ATF4-dependent transcription. Moreover, we find that menin inhibition similarly leads to loss of ATF4 and the ATF4-dependent transcriptional signature in MLL-rearranged B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, extending our findings to another cancer in which menin serves an oncogenic role. IMPLICATIONS: These studies provide new insights into metabolic reprogramming in Ewing sarcoma and also uncover a previously undescribed role for menin in the regulation of ATF4.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Activating Transcription Factor 4, Biosynthetic Pathways, Bone Neoplasms, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, HEK293 Cells, Humans, Oncogene Proteins, Fusion, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Protein Binding, Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, RNA Interference, RNA-Binding Protein EWS, Sarcoma, Ewing, Serine"

One aspect of leukaemic cell resistance to chemotherapy is the development of clones with increased capacity to respond to cellular stress and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thanks in particular to a high aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) 1A1/2 activity. At diagnosis, ROS level and ALDH1A1/2 activity in AML patients BM are correlated with the different ELN 2022 prognostic groups and overall survival (OS). A significant lower ALDH1A1/2 activity in BM was observed in the favourable ELN2022 subgroup compared to the intermediate and adverse group (p < 0.01). In the same way, the ROS levels were significantly lower in the favourable ELN 2022 subgroup compared to the intermediate group (p < 0.0001) and adverse group (p < 0.0002). ROS<sup>high</sup> AML patients had a significantly lower median overall survival (OS) (8.2 months) than ROS<sup>low</sup> patients (24.6 months) (p = 0.0368).

Itacitinib resulted in low CRS grades, all patients had grade 0 (22%) or grade 1 (78%) CRS and there were no cases of grade 2 to 5 CRS. There were no cases of primary graft failure. No patients developed grade 3 to 4 acute GVHD (aGVHD) through day +180. The cumulative incidence of grade 2 aGVHD at day +100 was 21.9%. The 1-year cumulative incidence of moderate or severe chronic GVHD was 5%. The cumulative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 14%. OS at 1 year was 80%. The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at day 180 was 8%. Itacitinib, when added to standard GVHD prophylaxis, was well tolerated and resulted in low rates of CRS, acute and chronic GVHD, and NRM, and encouraging rates of GVHD-free relapse-free survival and OS after haplo-HCT.

Four CARs were based on the CD123-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) 26292 (292) and one CAR on the CD123-specific scFv 26716 (716), respectively. We designed CARs with different hinge/transmembrane (H/TM) domains and costimulatory domains, in combination with the zeta (z) signaling domain: 292.CD8aH/TM.41BBz (8.41BBz), 292.CD8aH/TM.CD28z (8.28z), 716.CD8aH/TM.CD28z (716.8.28z), 292.CD28H/TM.

We analyzed the prognostic value of achieving a negative MRD in older/""unfit"" patients with AML receiving first-line therapy with 10-day decitabine and venetoclax. MRD was evaluated in bone marrow specimens using multicolor flow cytometry (sensitivity 0.1%). Ninety-seven patients achieving either a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) or morphologic leukemia-free state were included. Median age was 72 years (interquartile range, 68-78 years), and 64% had adverse-risk AML. Eighty-three patients achieved CR/CRi, and 52 (54%) became MRD negative. Median time to becoming MRD negative was 2.0 months (interquartile range, 0.9-3.1 months). Patients becoming MRD negative by 2 months had longer relapse-free survival (RFS) compared with those remaining MRD positive (median RFS, not reached vs 5.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.78; P = .004), longer event-free survival (EFS) (median EFS, not reached vs 5.8 months; HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.55; P < .001), as well as longer overall survival (OS) (median OS, 25.1 vs 7.1 months; HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11-0.51; P < .001). Patients achieving an MRD-negative CR had longer OS compared with those with an inferior response (median OS, 25.1 vs 11.6 months; HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.58; P < .0005). Patients becoming MRD negative within 1 month had an improved OS compared with MRD-positive patients (median OS, 25.1 vs 3.4 months; HR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.64; P < .0001).

Natural killer (NK) cell-based therapy is a promising modality to treat post-HCT relapse.MethodsWe initiated this ongoing phase I trial of adoptively transferred cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells in patients with myeloid malignancies who relapsed after haploidentical HCT. All patients received a donor-derived NK cell dose of 5 to 10 million cells/kg after lymphodepleting chemotherapy, followed by systemic IL-2 for 7 doses. High-resolution profiling with mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing characterized the expanding and persistent NK cell subpopulations in a longitudinal manner after infusion.ResultsIn the first 6 enrolled patients on the trial, infusion of CIML NK cells led to a rapid 10- to 50-fold in vivo expansion that was sustained over months. The infusion was well tolerated, with fever and pancytopenia as the most common adverse events. Expansion of NK cells was distinct from IL-2 effects on endogenous post-HCT NK cells, and not dependent on CMV viremia. Immunophenotypic and transcriptional profiling revealed a dynamic evolution of the activated CIML NK cell phenotype, superimposed on the natural variation in donor NK cell repertoires.ConclusionGiven their rapid expansion and long-term persistence in an immune-compatible environment, CIML NK cells serve as a promising platform for the treatment of posttransplant relapse of myeloid disease.

This is evidenced by subjective and objective measures of executive functions (EFs). However, the two measures do not always align, and the EF discrepancy in this population is understudied. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine the association between global measures of subjective and objective EF in young adult (YA) survivors of childhood ALL. Second, we aimed to explore how psychological distress, fatigue, self-efficacy, and estimated IQ relate to the discrepancy between these measures. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> A total of 53 subjects (age 18-34) participated in a clinical trial baseline assessment (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04541056). The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function for Adults assessed subjective EFs. Results from six neurocognitive tests were combined to represent objective EFs. Discrepancy scores were calculated by subtracting the objective EF composite score from the subjective EF score. Spearman's correlations and simple and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to explore associations and predictors for the global EF discrepancy. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Subjective and objective measures of EF were moderately correlated (<i>r</i><sub>s</sub> = 0.407). The regression analyses showed that psychological distress (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.44), fatigue (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.29), and self-efficacy (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.24) significantly predicted the global EF discrepancy (<i>p</i> < .001). Only psychological distress explained unique variation (<i>B</i> = -0.46). <b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> Neurocognitive tests and self-reports offer valuable insights into EF assessment for YA survivors. Psychological distress emerged as the most central contributor to the overall EF discrepancy.

In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the clinical significance of residual NPCs throughout the entire disease course in 1363 myeloma patients from the NICHE cohort (NCT04645199). Our results revealed that myeloma patients with high baseline NPCs ratio (≥5%) exhibited distinct indolent features, characterized by lower tumor burden, reduced frequencies of cytopenia, immunoparesis, and high-risk cytogenetics. Importantly, high residual NPCs ratio at diagnosis or relapse was independently associated with favorable survival. High absolute percentages of NPCs at undetectable MRD were related with superior clinical benefit and immune reconstitution. At MRD-positive phases, grouping based on NPCs ratio (<50%, 50-90%, ≥90%) demonstrated better risk stratification compared to residual tumor log levels. Based on the time-dependent NPCs ratio trend, we developed a dynamic MRD model that classifies patients into three groups with diverse longitudinal trends, leading to distinct prognoses.

To address these issues, we analyzed the interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) results of 995 newly diagnosed MM (NDMM) patients and 293 patients with MM at their first relapse. Among these patients, 197 had paired iFISH data at diagnosis and first relapse. Our analysis of paired iFISH revealed that a minor clone of del(17p) at relapse but not at diagnosis was associated with poor prognosis in MM (hazard ratio for median overall survival 1.64 vs. 1.44). Fifty-six and 12 patients developed one or more new cytogenetic abnormalities at relapse, mainly del(17p) and gain/amp(1q), respectively. We classified the patients into six groups based on the change patterns in the clonal size of del(17p) between the two time points. Patients who did not have del(17p) during follow-up showed the best outcomes, whereas those who acquired del(17p) during their disease course, experienced compromised survival (median overall survival: 61.3 vs. 49.4 months; hazard ratio =1.64; 95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.56; P<0.05).

Donor T cells not only facilitate engraftment and protect against opportunistic pathogens and residual disease, but can also cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), with significant morbidity and mortality. Complete T-cell depletion can not only substantially reduce GVHD rates but can also delay immune reconstitution and increase rates of opportunistic infections and relapse. Murine models have shown that naive T cells (TNs) consistently cause severe GVHD, whereas memory T cells cause milder or no GVHD and have critical graft-versus-tumor function. Informed by experiments performed in murine models of HCT, clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate TN-depleted peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts. These trials are showing very low rates of chronic GVHD and of serious acute GVHD in the HLA-matched HCT setting, with lower frequencies of opportunistic infections than after fully T-cell-depleted HCT and no apparent increase in relapse rates. Randomized clinical trials are ongoing, comparing standard unselected HCT with TN-depleted PBSCs and other promising GVHD-reduction strategies. Correlative laboratory studies will clarify how antitumor function is retained in TN-depleted HCT and inform strategies to further augment graft-versus-leukemia in patients at a high risk of relapse.

As a result, over the last two decades substantial efforts have been directed towards identification and development of pharmaceutical CDK inhibitors. Insights into the biological consequences of CDK inhibition in specific tumor types have led to the successful development of CDK4/6 inhibitors as treatments for certain types of breast cancer. More recently, a new generation of pharmaceutical inhibitors of CDK enzymes that regulate the transcription of key oncogenic and pro-survival proteins, including CDK9, have entered clinical development. Here, we provide the first disclosure of the chemical structure of fadraciclib (CYC065), a CDK inhibitor and clinical candidate designed by further optimization from the aminopurine scaffold of seliciclib. We describe its synthesis and mechanistic characterization. Fadraciclib exhibits improved potency and selectivity for CDK2 and CDK9 compared to seliciclib, and also displays high selectivity across the kinome. We show that the mechanism of action of fadraciclib is consistent with potent inhibition of CDK9-mediated transcription, decreasing levels of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain serine 2 phosphorylation, the pro-survival protein Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 (MCL1) and MYC oncoprotein, and inducing rapid apoptosis in cancer cells. This cellular potency and mechanism of action translate to promising anti-cancer activity in human leukemia mouse xenograft models. Studies of leukemia cell line sensitivity identify mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene status and the level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family proteins as potential markers for selection of patients with greater sensitivity to fadraciclib. We show that the combination of fadraciclib with BCL2 inhibitors, including venetoclax, is synergistic in leukemic cell models, as predicted from simultaneous inhibition of MCL1 and BCL2 pro-survival pathways. Fadraciclib preclinical pharmacology data support its therapeutic potential in CDK9- or CDK2-dependent cancers and as a rational combination with BCL2 inhibitors in hematological malignancies. Fadraciclib is currently in Phase 1 clinical studies in patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT02552953) and also in combination with venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (NCT03739554) and relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (NCT04017546).","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adenosine, Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic, Cell Cycle Checkpoints, Cell Line, Tumor, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9, Cyclin-Dependent Kinases, Humans, Mice, Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, Sulfonamides"

To evaluate whether targeting the IL-1β signaling pathway can rescue ineffective erythropoiesis in patients with MDS, we designed a phase 2 non-randomized single-arm clinical trial (NCT04239157) to assess the safety profile and efficacy of the IL-1β inhibitor canakinumab in previously treated lower-risk MDS patients. We enrolled 25 patients with a median age of 74 years; 60% were male, 16% had lower-risk MDS, 84% had intermediate-1 risk MDS according to the International Prognostic Scoring System score, and 80% failed hypomethylating agent therapy. The study met the primary endpoint of defining the clinical activity of canakinumab, and the secondary objective of determining the safety profile, including the rate of transfusion independence, the duration of response, progression-free survival, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival. The overall response rate was 17.4%, with all responses including hematological improvement. Sequential post-hoc prospective single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of HSPCs and bone marrow mononuclear cells at different time points during therapy showed that canakinumab's on-target effects in hematopoietic populations expressing the IL-1β receptor decreased the TNF-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway but rescued ineffective erythropoiesis only in the context of lower genetic complexity. This study demonstrates that better stratification strategies could target lower-risk MDS patients more effectively.","Journal Article, Clinical Trial, Phase II","Humans, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Male, Interleukin-1beta, Female, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized, Aged, Middle Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Erythropoiesis, Treatment Outcome"

However, prospective data on this low intensity therapy in treatment-naive younger AML patients are lacking. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of venetoclax plus decitabine (VEN-DEC) as induction in untreated young fit AML patients in a randomized trial. Patients aged 18-59 years eligible for intensive chemotherapy were randomized 1:1 to receive VEN-DEC or IA-12 (idarubicin and cytarabine). All patients achieving CR/CRi underwent high-dose cytarabine consolidation. The primary endpoint was the composite complete remission rate (CRc) rate after induction therapy. Of 255 screened, 188 were enrolled and randomly assigned, with 94 in each group. In the intention-to-treat population, CRc was 89% (84/94) in the VEN-DEC group versus 79% (74/94) in IA-12 (non-inferiority P = 0.0021). MRD negativity after induction was 80% (67/84) versus 76% (56/74), respectively. VEN-DEC showed superior CRc in patients aged ≥40 years (91% vs. 75%), those with adverse risk (91% vs. 42%) or epigenetic mutations (91% vs. 67%) , but lower CRc in RUNX1::RUNX1T1 fusion cases (44% vs. 88%) compared to IA-12. Patients in the VEN-DEC group experienced fewer grade ≥3 infections (32% vs. 67%) and shorter severe thrombocytopenia duration (median 13 vs. 19 days, P < 0.001). At a median follow-up of 12.1 months, overall and progression-free survival were similar between groups. In conclusion, VEN-DEC demonstrated non-inferior response rates with superior safety over IA-12 in young AML patients.

We identified leukemic stem cells (LSC) as primary targets of 5-AZA/VEN whose elimination determined the therapy outcome.

The implementation of functional precision medicine (FPM), which combines genomic profiling with drug sensitivity testing (DST) of patient-derived tumor cells, has potential to identify treatment options when standard-of-care is exhausted. The goal of this prospective observational study was to generate FPM data for pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory cancer. The primary objective was to determine the feasibility of returning FPM-based treatment recommendations in real time to the FPM tumor board (FPMTB) within a clinically actionable timeframe (<4 weeks). The secondary objective was to assess clinical outcomes from patients enrolled in the study. Twenty-five patients with relapsed or refractory solid and hematological cancers were enrolled; 21 patients underwent DST and 20 also completed genomic profiling. Median turnaround times for DST and genomics were within 10 days and 27 days, respectively. Treatment recommendations were made for 19 patients (76%), of whom 14 received therapeutic interventions. Six patients received subsequent FPM-guided treatments. Among these patients, five (83%) experienced a greater than 1.3-fold improvement in progression-free survival associated with their FPM-guided therapy relative to their previous therapy, and demonstrated a significant increase in progression-free survival and objective response rate compared to those of eight non-guided patients. The findings from our proof-of-principle study illustrate the potential for FPM to positively impact clinical care for pediatric and adolescent patients with relapsed or refractory cancers and warrant further validation in large prospective studies.

In these vulnerable patients, vaccine effectiveness is reduced by post-transplant immune-suppressive therapy; consequently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) is often associated with elevated morbidity and mortality. Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 adaptive immunity transfer from immune donors to HCT recipients in the context of immunosuppression will help identify optimal timing and vaccination strategies that can provide adequate protection to HCT recipients against infection with evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants. We performed a prospective observational study (NCT04666025 at ClinicalTrials.gov) to longitudinally monitor the transfer of SARS-CoV-2-specific antiviral immunity from HCT donors, who were either vaccinated or had a history of COVID-19, to their recipients <i>via</i> T-cell replete graft. Levels, function, and quality of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses were longitudinally analyzed up to 6 months post-HCT in 14 matched unrelated donor/recipients and four haploidentical donor/recipient pairs. A markedly skewed donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 CD4 T-cell response was measurable in 15 (83%) recipients. It showed a polarized Th1 functional profile, with the prevalence of central memory phenotype subsets. SARS-CoV-2-specific IFN-γ was detectable throughout the observation period, including early post-transplant (day +30). Functionally experienced SARS-CoV-2 Th1-type T cells promptly expanded in two recipients at the time of post-HCT vaccination and in two others who were infected and survived post-transplant COVID-19 infection. Our data suggest that donor-derived SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses are functional in immunosuppressed recipients and may play a critical role in post-HCT vaccine response and protection from the fatal disease.","Observational Study, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Humans, COVID-19, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, SARS-CoV-2, Tissue Donors, Transplant Recipients, T-Lymphocytes, COVID-19 Vaccines"

Zilovertamab vedotin (ZV) is an antibody–drug conjugate comprising a monoclonal antibody recognizing extracellular ROR1, a cleavable linker, and the anti-microtubule cytotoxin monomethyl auristatin E. METHODS: In this phase 1, first-in-human, dose-escalation study, we accrued patients with previously treated lymphoid cancers to receive ZV every 3 weeks until the occurrence of cancer progression or unacceptable toxicity had occurred. RESULTS: We enrolled 32 patients with tumor histologies of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (n=15), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n=7), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (n=5), follicular lymphoma (n=3), Richter transformation lymphoma (n=1), or marginal zone lymphoma (n=1). Patients had received a median of four previous drug and/or cellular therapies. Starting dose levels were 0.5 (n=1), 1.0 (n=3), 1.5 (n=3), 2.25 (n=11), and 2.5 (n=14) mg per kg of body weight (mg/kg). Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data documented systemic ZV exposure and exposure-dependent ZV targeting of ROR1 on circulating tumor cells. As expected with an monomethyl auristatin E-containing antibody–drug conjugate, adverse events (AEs) included acute neutropenia and cumulative neuropathy resulting in a recommended ZV dosing regimen of 2.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks. No clinically concerning AEs occurred to suggest ROR1-mediated toxicities or nonspecific ZV binding to normal tissues. ZV induced objective tumor responses in 7 of 15 patients with MCL (47%; 4 partial and 3 complete) and in 3 of 5 patients with DLBCL (60%; 1 partial and 2 complete); objective tumor responses were not observed among patients with other tumor types. CONCLUSIONS: In heavily pretreated patients, ZV demonstrated no unexpected toxicities and showed evidence of antitumor activity, providing clinical proof of concept for selective targeting of ROR1 as a potential new approach to cancer therapy.

The advent of therapies that can disrupt some of the stimulatory signaling afforded by the microenvironment has ushered in a new era of targeted therapy, which has dramatically improved clinical outcome and patient survival. Future advances are required for patients who develop intolerance or resistance to current targeted therapies. These may be found by investigating novel drugs that can inhibit identified targets, such as the pathways involved in B-cell receptor signaling, or by developing agents that inhibit additional targets of the leukemia microenvironment. This review describes some of the molecules involved in promoting the growth and/or survival of CLL cells and discusses targeting strategies that may become tomorrow's therapy for patients with CLL.","Journal Article, Review","Humans, Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell, Molecular Targeted Therapy, Signal Transduction, Tumor Microenvironment"

Treatment options for RS are limited and the disease is often fatal. Receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is expressed on CLL cells and other cancers but not on healthy adult tissues, making it an attractive, tumor-specific therapeutic target. VLS-101 is being developed as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for therapy of ROR1-expressing (ROR1+) cancers. VLS-101 comprises UC-961 (a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that binds an extracellular epitope of human ROR1), a maleimidocaproyl-valine-citrulline-para-aminobenzoate linker, and the antimicrotubule cytotoxin monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). VLS-101 binding to ROR1 results in rapid cellular internalization and delivery of MMAE to induce tumor cell death. We studied 4 RS patient-derived xenografts (RS-PDXs) with varying levels of ROR1 expression (11%, 32%, 85%, and 99% of cells). VLS-101 showed no efficacy in the lowest-expressing RS-PDX but induced complete remissions in those with higher levels of ROR1 expression. Responses were maintained during the posttherapy period, particularly after higher VLS-101 doses. In systemic ROR1+ RS-PDXs, VLS-101 dramatically decreased tumor burden in all RS-colonized tissues and significantly prolonged survival. Animals showed no adverse effects or weight loss. Our results confirm ROR1 as a target in RS and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of using an ADC directed toward ROR1 for the treatment of hematological cancers. A phase 1 clinical trial of VLS-101 (NCT03833180) is ongoing in patients with RS and other hematological malignancies.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Aminobenzoates, Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological, Drug Delivery Systems, Humans, Immunoconjugates, Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell, Mice, Mice, Inbred NOD, Mice, Knockout, Mice, SCID, Neoplasm Proteins, Oligopeptides, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"

Tumor dependence on Mcl-1 is associated with resistance to venetoclax. Voruciclib, an oral cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor targeting CDK9, indirectly decreases Mcl-1 protein expression and synergizes with venetoclax in preclinical models. This dose escalation study evaluated voruciclib in patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies. Initially, voruciclib was administered daily, continuously, on a 28-day cycle (group 1). After 2 patients with prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of interstitial pneumonitis at 100 mg, voruciclib administration was changed to days 1 to 14 of a 28-day cycle (group 2). Forty patients, 21 with AML and 19 with B-cell malignancies, were enrolled. Patients had a median of 3 prior lines of therapy (range, 1-8). Dose escalation in group 2 was stopped at 200 mg, a dose that achieved plasma concentrations sufficient for target inhibition, without DLTs observed. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (30%), nausea (25%), anemia (22%), fatigue (22%), constipation (17%), dizziness (15%), and dyspnea (15%). In AML, 1 patient achieved a morphologic leukemia-free state, and 2 had stable disease. Voruciclib treatment led to a decrease in MCL1 messenger RNA expression, downregulation of myelocytomatosis (MYC) and NF-κB transcriptional gene sets, and reduced phosphorylation of RNA polymerase 2. Voruciclib on intermittent dosing was well tolerated, with no DLTs, paving the way for evaluation of the combination of voruciclib with venetoclax for patients with previously treated AML.

Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively. In 25 of 51 (49%) patients without hematologic malignancy, somatic mutations were detected in at least 1 of the clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) genes or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driver genes. BCOR was the most frequently mutated gene (in 9 patients), and multiple BCOR mutations were identified in 4 patients. Mutations in 6 other CHIP- or AML-driver genes (TET2, DNMT3A, KRAS, LRP1B, IDH1, and KMT2C) were also found in ≥2 patients without hematologic malignancy.
