Physical symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, mucositis, insomnia, loss of appetite, constipation and diarrhea, among others, have a huge impact on quality of life, temporarily until symptomatic control, but also permanently with the development of anxiety, depression, long-term fatigue and post-traumatic stress. As recommended by ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology), the palliative approach to oncological diseases must be as early as possible and be part of the ""standard of care"". However, the lack of concrete data on this topic in the last decade served as a barrier to the early integration of this same care for hemato-oncology patients in its various areas. Palliative care presupposes global, interdisciplinary action, carried out by specific teams that must act in situations of incurable or serious illness, in an advanced and progressive phase.

Total marrow and lymphoid irradiation targets cancer in bone marrow and blood, instead of applying radiation to the whole body. Giving total bone marrow and lymphoid irradiation before a donor transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

The body has different ways of fighting disease and infection, and this research study combines two different ways of fighting cancer with antibodies and T cells with the hope that they will work together. T cells (also called T lymphocytes) are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells including tumor cells. Antibodies are types of proteins that protect the body from bacterial and other infectious diseases. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers; they have shown promise, but have not been strong enough to cure most patients when used alone.

T lymphocytes can kill tumor cells but there normally are not enough of them to kill all the tumor cells. Some researchers have taken T cells from a person's blood, grown more of them in the laboratory and then given them back to the person. The antibody used in this study targets CLL-1. This antibody sticks to AML cells because of a substance (protein) on the outside of these cells called CLL-1. For this study, the antibody to CLL-1 has been changed so that instead of floating free in the blood, it is now joined to the T cells. When T-cells contain an antibody that is joined to them, they are called chimeric antigen receptor T-cells or CAR-T cells.

In the laboratory, the investigators have also found that T cells work better if proteins that stimulate T cells are also added, such as one called CD28. Adding the CD28 makes the cells grow better and last longer in the body, thus giving the cells a better chance of killing the leukemia or lymphoma cells. In this study we are going to attach the CLL-1 chimeric receptor that has CD28 added to it to the patient's T cells. We will then test how long the cells last.

Severe forms are reported in children receiving chemotherapy for AL. However, the main risk, largely underestimated, is related to delay in chemotherapy administration in case of infection, leading to an increased risk of relapse. Therefore, it is justified to propose an anti-Covid-19 vaccination to these patients. Vaccination of siblings also seems necessary given the uncertainty regarding vaccine response in children with AL and given that household is the main source of contamination.

NCT04293562,A Study to Compare Standard Chemotherapy to Therapy With CPX-351 and/or Gilteritinib for Patients With Newly Diagnosed AML With or Without FLT3 Mutations,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04293562,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"This phase III trial compares standard chemotherapy to therapy with liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine (CPX-351) and/or gilteritinib for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia with or without FLT3 mutations. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as daunorubicin, cytarabine, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. CPX-351 is made up of daunorubicin and cytarabine and is made in a way that makes the drugs stay in the bone marrow longer and could be less likely to cause heart problems than traditional anthracycline drugs, a common class of chemotherapy drug. Some acute myeloid leukemia patients have an abnormality in the structure of a gene called FLT3. Genes are pieces of DNA (molecules that carry instructions for development, functioning, growth and reproduction) inside each cell that tell the cell what to do and when to grow and divide. FLT3 plays an important role in the normal making of blood cells. This gene can have permanent changes that cause it to function abnormally by making cancer cells grow. Gilteritinib may block the abnormal function of the FLT3 gene that makes cancer cells grow. The overall goals of this study are, 1) to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of CPX-351 with daunorubicin and cytarabine on people with newly diagnosed AML to find out which is better, 2) to study the effects, good and/or bad, of adding gilteritinib to AML therapy for patients with high amounts of FLT3/ITD or other FLT3 mutations and 3) to study changes in heart function during and after treatment for AML.

Demethylation drug not only prove the effect of chemotherapy, but also change leukemia microenvironment through epigenetics modification. Both of them will result in eliminating MRD in patients with AML.

NCT06865352,Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Donor-derived Anti-leukemia Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes for the Prevention of Leukemia Relapse in Children Given Haploidentical Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06865352,COMPLETED,"The prognosis for children affected by acute leukemia and transplanted in an advanced disease stage, in the presence of MRD or with unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities, is still poor. Optimizing post-transplant management to maintain durable remission represents the greatest challenge to improve the outcome of pediatric patients with acute leukemia given an allogeneic HSCT.

The pivotal therapeutic role of immunity against acute leukemia has been highlighted by the immunological effect of donor T cells (GVL) observed following allogeneic HSCT, which is considered the only curative strategy for this type of cancer. Moreover, circulating leukemia-specific CTLs have been detected in patients with different forms of acute leukemia, and the presence of these specific T-cell responses in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of leukemic patients has been associated with improved disease control and longer survival. This body of data suggests that immunological interventions could have an effect in preventing relapse and improving transplant outcome.

Unmanipulated donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) is used after stem cell transplantation to treat and prevent relapse, to prevent infections and to establish full donor chimerism. However, an expected side effect of the presence of mature T cells is the potential occurrence of acute GvHD. Evidence has emerged that escalating DLI has achieved higher clinical response rates with lower GvHD occurrence. Optimization of DLI dose and schedule as well as strategies of donor T-cell manipulation may lead to the consistent ability to separate GvHD from GvL activity and improve the safety of DLI treatment. One way to manipulate donor lymphocytes to reduce GVHD is leukemia antigen stimulation, in order to increase antileukemia activity while reducing the number of alloreactive T cells by specific culture.

The aim of this study is to enhance the GVL effect, and reduce the rate of post-transplant relapse, with preventive post-HSCT infusions of donor anti-leukemia CTLs specifically directed to patient's leukemic blasts. The leukemia-reactive CTLs obtained by stimulation with patients' leukemia blasts are specific for each individual blast signature, and, due to their physiological recognition and effector mechanism through their natural T cell receptor, exert leukemia-specific killing with less severe adverse reactions than CAR-T cells. Moreover, due to their potential to recognize multiple leukemia-associated antigens present on the blast surface, they should be less prone to immune evasion strategies exerted by leukemic stem cells. Additionally, the risk of GVHD should be reduced by the culture procedure, which decreases the number of alloreactive T cells. For the reasons stated, the use of these T cells after HSCT in a highly personalized approach may be a safer and more efficient option than unmanipulated donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) to prevent leukemia relapse after HSCT.",NO,Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ALL|Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML),BIOLOGICAL: HSCT donor leukemia-specific cytotoxic T-cells,"Safety evaluated as the incidence of acute GVHD, Acute GVHD will be diagnosed and graded according to the NIH criteria.

Some patients with Lymphoma or T/NK-lymphoproliferative disease show signs of virus that is sometimes called Epstein Barr virus (EBV). This virus causes mononucleosis or glandular fever (""mono"") before or at the time of their diagnosis. EBV is found in the cancer cells of up to half the patients with Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. This suggests that the EBV plays a role in causing Lymphoma. The cancer cells (in lymphoma) and some immune system cells infected by EBV are able to hide from the body's immune system and escape destruction.

T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including cells infected with viruses and tumor cells. T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. T cells, that have been trained to kill EBV infected cells can survive in blood and affect the tumor. We have treated over 80 people on studies using T cells to target these diseases. About half of those patients who had disease at the time they got the cells had responses including some patients with complete responses (meaning the cancer could no longer be detected).

We think that if T cells are able to last longer in the body, they may have a better chance of killing EBV and EBV infected tumor cells. Therefore, in this study we will add a new gene to the EBV T cells that can cause the cells to live longer called C7R. We know that T cells need substances called cytokines (substances such as proteins released by specific cells of the immune system) to survive and that the cells may not get enough cytokines after the cells are infused into the body. We have added the gene C7R that gives the cells a constant supply of cytokine and helps them to survive for a longer period of time.

The purpose of this study is to find the largest safe dose of C7R-EBV T cells, and additionally to evaluate how long they can be detected in the blood and what affect they have on the cancer.",NO,"Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute|Leukemia, B-cell|Leukemia, T-Cell|Lymphoma",BIOLOGICAL: Treatment Arm A,"Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) rate, 1.

NCT05066958,Ex-vivo Primed Memory Donor Lymphocyte Infusion to Boost Anti-viral Immunity After T-cell Depleted HSCT,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05066958,UNKNOWN,"HSCT from an allogeneic donor is the standard therapy for high-risk hematopoietic malignancies and a wide range of severe non-malignant diseases of the blood and immune system. The possibility of performing HSCT was significantly limited by the availability of donors compatible with the MHC system. However, modern ex-vivo and in vivo technologies for depletion of T lymphocytes have made it possible to improve the outcomes of HSCT from partially compatible related (haploidentical) donors. In representative groups, it was shown that the success of HSCT from haploidentical donors is not inferior to standard procedures of HSCT from HLA-compatible unrelated donors. HSCT from haploidentical donors in children associated with the deficit of the adaptive immune response, which persists up to 6 months after HSCT and can be an increased risk of death of the patient from opportunistic infections. To solve this problem, the method of infusion of low doses of donor memory T lymphocytes was introduced. This technology is based on the possibility of adoptive transfer of memory immune response to key viral pathogens from donor to recipient. Such infusions have been shown to be safe and to accelerate the recovery of the pathogen-specific immune response. The expansion of virus-specific T lymphocytes in the recipient's body depends on exposure to the relevant antigen in vivo. Thus, in the absence of contact with the viral antigen, the adoptive transfer of memory T lymphocytes is not accompanied in vivo by the expansion of virus-specific lymphocytes and does not form a circulating pool of memory T lymphocytes, that can protect the patient from infections. Therefore the investigators assume that ex-vivo priming of donor memory lymphocytes with relevant antigens can provide optimal antigenic stimulation and may solve the problem of restoring immunological reactivity in the early stages after HSCT. Technically ex-vivo primed memory T lymphocytes will be generated by short incubation of CD45RA-depleted fraction of the graft (a product of T lymphocyte depletion) with a pool of GMP-quality peptides representing a number of key proteins of the viral pathogens. The following are proposed as targeted antigens: CMV pp65, EBV EBNA-1, EBV LMP12A, Adeno AdV5 Hexon, BKV LT, BKV VP1. An infusion of donor memory lymphocytes will be performed on the day +1 after transplantation. Parameters of the assessment will be safety and efficacy (immune response by day 60 and stability (responses by day 180).",NO,"Acute Myeloid Leukemia|High Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, in Relapse|High Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Acute Biphenotypic Leukemia in Relapse|Non-hodgkin Lymphoma|Myelodysplastic Syndromes",BIOLOGICAL: boost anti-viral immunity after T-cell depleted HSCT,"acute Graft Versus Host Disease, Cumulative risk of developing of acute Graft Versus Host Disease (aGVHD) (evaluation period is 100 days) stage II-IV, 100 days after HSCT|The proportion of patients with detectable T-cell response (IFNgamma ELISPOT) to CMV, The proportion of patients with detectable peripheral blood T-lymphocytes specific for CMV antigens, after HSCT by day + 30 and by day + 180|The proportion of patients with detectable T-cell response (IFNgamma ELISPOT) to ADV, The proportion of patients with detectable peripheral blood T-lymphocytes specific for ADV antigens, after HSCT by day + 30 and by day + 180|The proportion of patients with detectable T-cell response (IFNgamma ELISPOT) to EBV, The proportion of patients with detectable peripheral blood T-lymphocytes specific for EBV antigens, after HSCT by day + 30 and by day + 180","Cumulative Incidence of developing chronic GVHD, Cumulative Incidence of developing chronic GVHD, after HSCT up to 2 years|Cumulative Incidence of recurrence of leukemia CI of relapse, Cumulative Incidence of recurrence of leukemia, after HSCT up to 2 years|TRM, Cumulative Incidence of transplant-related mortality, after HSCT up to 2 years|OS, Overall survival, after HSCT up to 2 years",,"Federal Research Institute of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology",,"CHILD, ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: PREVENTION,2021-09-16,2022-09-01,2022-12-01

Total body irradiation is a form of radiotherapy that involves irradiating the patient's entire body in an attempt to suppress the immune system, prevent rejection of the transplanted bone marrow and/or stem cells and to wipe out any remaining cancer cells. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a more recently developed method of delivering radiation. Total marrow and lymphoid irradiation is a method of using IMRT to direct radiation to the bone marrow.

Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells, where too many underdeveloped (abnormal) white blood cells, called ""blasts"", are found in the bone marrow, which is the soft, spongy center of the bones that produces the three major blood cells: white blood cells to fight infection; red blood cells that carry oxygen; and platelets that help blood clot and stop bleeding. The blasts crowd out the normal blood cells in the bone marrow and spread to the blood. They can also spread to the brain, spinal cord, and/or other organs of the body. The leukemia cells of some children have a genetic change in which a gene (KMT2A) is broken and combined with other genes that typically do not interact with one another; this is called ""rearranged"". This genetic rearrangement alters how other genes are turned on or off in the cell, turning on genes that drive the development of leukemia. Patients with KMT2A rearrangement have higher risk for cancer coming back after treatment. Revumenib is an oral medicine that directly targets the changes that occur in a cell with a KMT2A rearrangement and has been shown to specifically kill these leukemia cells in preclinical laboratory settings and in animals. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, prednisone, asparaginase, fludarabine and cytarabine work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

NCT04226768,Enhanced Palliative Care in MDS and AML,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04226768,UNKNOWN,"Objectives:

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of enhanced haematology palliative care services to the most symptomatic group of blood cancer patients, namely myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).

Hypothesis to be tested:

To test whether early integration of dedicated palliative care will improve the quality of life, mood and caregiver burden in patients with MDS and AML.

Design and subjects:

This is a 24-month open-label randomized controlled trial. Subjects include patients with MDS and AML.

Study instruments:

Interventions will be carried out by a dedicated team comprising palliative care physicians, haematologists, palliative care nurse specialists, and social workers. Outcome measures will be determined using validated questionnaires and data collection tools.

Interventions:

In this trial, enhanced haematology palliative care integrated to conventional supportive care versus conventional supportive care alone will be compared.

Main outcome measures:

The primary outcome measures include quality of life, mood and caregiver burden. The secondary outcome measures include number of admissions to acute hospital and intensive care and overall survival.",NO,Myelodysplastic Syndromes,"OTHER: Enhanced Haematology Palliative Care (""Fast-track"") Group|OTHER: Conventional Care","McGill Quality of Life (MQOL) Questionnaire Score, It is a 17-item patient-rated measure of QOL for patients receiving palliative care.This questionnaire was translated and validated in Hong Kong. The questionnaire consists of five domains: physical well-being (five items), psychological well-being (six items), existential well-being (four items), support (two items), and sexual function (one item). In addition, there is a single item to rate their perceived quality of life. The response categories are based on a numerical scale from 0-10 with verbal anchors at the end of the scale. For the final statistical analysis, all scores are transposed on a 0-10 scale, with 0 representing the least and 10 indicating the most desirable situation. The mean total QOL score is the average of all the 5 domain scores, with 0 representing the worst situation. The overall validation results of the MQOL-HK were acceptable. Cronbach's α for the MQOL-HK subscale ranged from 0.68 to 0.85., 24 weeks|Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Levels of anxiety and depression were self-rated by HADS, which has been found to perform well as a test for such symptoms in the general population, in cancer patients and in primary care patients. Subjects decide on how each item applies to them on a scale ranging from no feelings of anxiety or depression (0) to severe feelings of anxiety or depression (3), with scores ranging from 0 to 21 on each subscale. A subscale score of 8 to 10 indicates a possible case of anxiety or depression, whereas a subscale score of 11 or higher indicates a definite case of anxiety or depression. Severe depression or anxiety disorders are suspected for subjects scoring 15 or higher.24 The Cantonese-Chinese version of the HADS25 has been found to have good internal consistency (Cronbach's α=0.77), reasonable sensitivity (0.79) and specificity (0.80), as well as positive (0.77) and negative predictive values (0.82)., 24 weeks|Zariet Burden Interview (ZBI), The ZBI is a widely used 22-item assessment tool for measuring the caregiver's perceived burden in providing family care. The questionnaire was translated, and modified according to Hong Kong cultural standards.

The ZBI scale was developed to measure burden among family caregivers of persons with dementia; however, it has been used in other populations and was selected for this study because of the high reliability and validity of the Chinese version, indicated by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.99 and a correlation coefficient of 0.81. The correlation between ZBI and general Health Questionnaire was 0.59 (p\<0.001), and the correlation between Caregiver Activity Survey was 0.057 (p\<0.001), suggesting high conceptual validity.

The items were scored on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (always). Scores were calculated by summing up the total chosen statement which ranges from 0 to 88, that higher scores implying greater perceived caregiver burden., 24 weeks","Number of admissions to acute hospital, Number, 24 weeks|Number of admission to intensive care unit, Number, 24 weeks|Overall survival, Time (in weeks) from the data of recruitment to death or latest follow-up, 24 weeks",,The University of Hong Kong,,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SUPPORTIVE_CARE,2020-01-09,2023-12-30,2023-12-30

Although the efficacy of AML treatment has improved significantly in recent years, it remains one of the major diseases threatening human health. Current research on AML treatment mainly has two directions. One is the addition of new targeted therapy drugs, and the other research direction is to enhance the intensity of AML chemotherapy, including the use of large doses of anthracycline drugs or the use of high-dose cytarabine treatment.

Since the 1990s, induction remission has been achieved by using anthracyclines in combination with high-dose cytarabine. The ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) contends that high-dose induction chemotherapy fails to enhance the bone marrow remission rate but elevates the chemotherapy-related mortality rate. Bradstock and the Australian Group also noted that although it does not increase the bone marrow remission rate, it can result in longer survival time and disease-free survival time. The clinical study from EORTC-GIMEMA AML-12 discovered that AML patients under the age of 45 could benefit from induction therapy incorporating high-dose cytarabine. In our previous randomized controlled clinical trials, it was found that the HAD and DA regimens containing intermediate-dose cytarabine could enhance the complete remission rate and improve the overall survival of adult AML. However, the degree of benefit varies among different AML subgroups.

The abnormalities of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and CBFβ-MYH11 respectively involve a subunit of CBF (core binding factor), thus the two are collectively called CBF leukemia. Previous retrospective studies show that this type of leukemia benefits from intensified treatment regimens such as FLAG. However, at present, there is a lack of prospective randomized controlled clinical studies to confirm this. Therefore, in this study, we intend to further verify through a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial whether the induction treatment regimen containing intermediate-dose cytarabine can improve the long-term efficacy of adult RUNX1-RUNX1T1 acute myeloid leukemia.",NO,AML|RUNX1-RUNX1T1 Fusion Protein Expression,DRUG: cytarabine|DRUG: daunorubicin|DRUG: idarubicin|DRUG: cyclophosphamide,"overall survival, Used to evaluate all patients who enter clinical trials.

NCT05577611,"An Open, Single Center, Randomized Controlled Clinical Study of UCB (Cord Blood) in the Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05577611,UNKNOWN,"In recent years, the curative effect of AML has been greatly improved. However, 20% - 30% of young patients and 40% - 50% of old patients will relapse again. Its re induction response rate is low, the survival period is short, and the prognosis is very poor. At present, there is no standard treatment scheme. Although a small number of patients can benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo HSCT), most patients lack suitable donors. The choice of high-dose chemotherapy is a rescue treatment scheme, but the treatment-related hematology or non hematology related toxicity and high mortality make the scheme controversial, especially for the elderly. Some studies have proposed a new treatment method combining chemotherapy with peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell infusion after mobilization of HLA mismatched donors. Preliminary clinical studies verified that after more than 70 cases of elderly acute myeloid leukemia were treated with microtransplantation, the complete remission rate reached 80%, the 2-year disease-free survival rate reached 39%, the early mortality rate was only 6.7%, and the median recovery time of neutrophils and platelets was 11 and 14.5 days, respectively, which was significantly different from the control group of chemotherapy alone. After that, the micro transplantation technology was extended to the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and lymphoma, and good results were also obtained. Compared with peripheral blood / bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells, umbilical cord blood (UCB) hematopoietic stem cells have the advantages of rapid access, convenient source, no harm to donors, and low requirements for HLA matching. The immune cells in cord blood hematopoietic stem cells are mostly Na ï ve and immature immune cells, so the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after unrelated cord blood transplantation are low, which not only reduces the failure of transplantation due to GVHD, but also avoids a series of complications and high costs brought by complex GVHD prevention and treatment techniques.

NCT06611839,Venetoclax and Ivosidenib Combined With Chemotherapy in IDH1 Mutated AML,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06611839,NOT_YET_RECRUITING,"Leukemia is one of the common malignant tumors threatening human health. Intensive chemotherapy or non-intensive chemotherapy has limited efficacy. There is an urgent need to improve treatment outcomes with more specific, well-designed drugs that target leukemia specifically.

The induction therapy of venetoclax combined with demethylation agents (HAM) significantly improves the response rate in elderly unfit AML patients (more than 60%), and studies are being conducted in venetoclax combination with intensive induction (3 + 7) and consolidation chemotherapy in newly treated AML patients.

Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 are present in the citric acid cycle. About 20% of AML patients carry IDH1 or IDH2 mutations that result in the reduction of alpha-ketoglutaric acid to 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG), which methylates intracellular histones and inhibits TET2 activity to hypermethylate DNA, thereby affecting gene expression and cell differentiation. IDH mutations are more common in older patients, are often cytogenetically-related, and can also co-occur with FLT3-ITD, NPM1, or DNMT3A mutations. Ivosidenib is an IDH1 inhibitor, and its safety and efficacy in the treatment of AML have been confirmed in previous studies. Based on the study of Montesinos et al. on the role of ivosidenib and azacitidine in IDH-mutated AML, for patients who cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy, a new treatment regimen has been added for AML patients with IDH1 mutation: ivosidenib combined with azacitidine can be selected for 1 cycle every 28 days or ivosidenib monotherapy.

NCT05436418,The Lowest Effective Dose of Post-Transplantation Cyclophosphamide in Combination With Sirolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil as Graft-Versus-Host Disease Prophylaxis After Reduced Intensity Conditioning and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05436418,RECRUITING,"Background:

Blood cancers (such as leukemias or lymphomas) often do not respond to standard treatments. A transplant of blood stem cells from a healthy donor can help people with these cancers. Sometimes these transplants cause serious side effects, including a common immunologic problem called graft-versus-host disease. A drug called cyclophosphamide given early after the transplant (post-transplantation cyclophosphamide, PTCy) can reduce these complications. But sometimes this drug has its own negative effects. Furthermore, studies in mice suggest that an intermediate, rather than very high, dose of this drug may best protect against graft-versus-host disease.

Objective:

To find out if a lower dose of PTCy is more helpful for people who undergo blood stem cell transplants.

Eligibility:

People aged 18 and older who have a blood cancer and are eligible for a transplant of blood stem cells from another person. Healthy donors are also needed but must be related to the individual needing the transplant.

Design:

Participants will undergo screening. Transplant recipients will have imaging scans and tests of their heart and lung function. They will be assessed for the status of their cancer, including bone marrow taken from their pelvis and possibly also scans and/or fluid drawn from the spine depending on the disease type.

Donors will be screened for general health. They will give several tubes of blood. They will give an oral swab and saliva and stool samples for research.

Recipients will be in the hospital at least 4 to 6 weeks.

They will have a temporary catheter inserted into a vein in the chest or neck. Medications will be given and blood will be drawn through the catheter.

The transplanted stem cells will be given through the catheter. Participants will receive medications both before and after the transplant.

Participants will return to the clinic at least once a week for 3 months after leaving the hospital.
