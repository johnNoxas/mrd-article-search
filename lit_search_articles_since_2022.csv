40122885,Bemcentinib as monotherapy and in combination with low-dose cytarabine in acute myeloid leukemia patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy: a phase 1b/2a trial.,"Loges Sonja, Heuser Michael, Chromik Jörg, Sutamtewagul Grerk, Kapp-Schwoerer Silke, Crugnola Monica, Di Renzo Nicola, Lemoli Roberto, Mattei Daniele, Fiedler Walter, Alvarado-Valero Yesid, Ben-Batalla Isabel, Waizenegger Jonas, Rieckmann Lisa-Marie, Janning Melanie, Collienne Maike, Imbusch Charles D, Beumer Niklas, Micklem David, H Nilsson Linn, Madeleine Noëlly, McCracken Nigel, Oliva Cristina, Gorcea-Carson Claudia, Gjertsen Bjørn T",Nature communications,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Mar', 'Day': '23'}","Beyond first line, the prognosis of relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients is poor with limited treatment options. Bemcentinib is an orally bioavailable, potent, highly selective inhibitor of AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with poor prognosis, chemotherapy resistance and decreased antitumor immune response. We report bemcentinib monotherapy and bemcentinib+low-dose cytarabine combination therapy arms from the completed BerGenBio-funded open-label Phase 1/2b trial NCT02488408 ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ), in patients unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy. The primary objective in the monotherapy arm was identification of maximum tolerated dose with secondary objectives to identify dose-limiting toxicities, safety and efficacy, and bemcentinib pharmacokinetic profile. In the combination arm, the primary objective was safety and tolerability, with efficacy and pharmacokinetics as secondary objectives. Safety and tolerability were based on standard clinical laboratory safety tests and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. Bemcentinib monotherapy (32 R/R, 2 treatment-naïve AML and 2 myelodysplasia patients) was well-tolerated and a loading/maintenance dose of 400/200 mg was selected for combination treatment, comprising 30 R/R and 6 treatment-naïve AML patients. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were cytopenia, febrile neutropenia and asymptomatic QTcF prolongation, with no grade 5 events reported. In conclusion, bemcentinib+low-dose cytarabine was safe and well tolerated.","Journal Article, Clinical Trial, Phase I, Clinical Trial, Phase II, Multicenter Study","Humans, Cytarabine, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Middle Aged, Female, Aged, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, Adult, Axl Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, Maximum Tolerated Dose, Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, Proto-Oncogene Proteins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT02488408']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase I', attributes={'UI': 'D017426'}), StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase II', attributes={'UI': 'D017427'}), StringElement('Multicenter Study', attributes={'UI': 'D016448'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02488408

However, clinical outcomes are unsatisfied for patients with intermediate/adverse cytogenetics based on European Leukemia Net (ELN) risk stratification 2022 (ELN 2022), and relapses also remain common even in patients with favorable-risk cytogenetics with measurable residual disease (MRD). There is an urgent unmet need for optimizing intensive chemotherapy regimens with novel agents, to enhance the MRD-negative rate, achieve durable remission, and improve the prognosis of AML. Preliminary results showed that adding a B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor to intensive chemotherapy could improve treatment efficacy. Sonrotoclax is a potent, selective, next-generation BCL-2 inhibitor that effectively inhibits both the wide-type BCL-2 and several BCL-2 mutants. We hypothesize that the addition of sonrotoclax to intensive chemotherapy may enhance the treatment efficacy for AML without untoward toxicity.

Tumor dependence on Mcl-1 is associated with resistance to venetoclax. Voruciclib, an oral cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor targeting CDK9, indirectly decreases Mcl-1 protein expression and synergizes with venetoclax in preclinical models. This dose escalation study evaluated voruciclib in patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies. Initially, voruciclib was administered daily, continuously, on a 28-day cycle (group 1). After 2 patients with prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of interstitial pneumonitis at 100 mg, voruciclib administration was changed to days 1 to 14 of a 28-day cycle (group 2). Forty patients, 21 with AML and 19 with B-cell malignancies, were enrolled. Patients had a median of 3 prior lines of therapy (range, 1-8). Dose escalation in group 2 was stopped at 200 mg, a dose that achieved plasma concentrations sufficient for target inhibition, without DLTs observed. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (30%), nausea (25%), anemia (22%), fatigue (22%), constipation (17%), dizziness (15%), and dyspnea (15%). In AML, 1 patient achieved a morphologic leukemia-free state, and 2 had stable disease. Voruciclib treatment led to a decrease in MCL1 messenger RNA expression, downregulation of myelocytomatosis (MYC) and NF-κB transcriptional gene sets, and reduced phosphorylation of RNA polymerase 2.

We have previously demonstrated that single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-based ""naturally selected"" CD7 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (NS7CAR-T) therapy shows significant efficacy, with a favorable safety profile in T-cell lymphoid malignancies. Here, we derived dual variable heavy-chain domain of a heavy-chain antibody (dVHH) NS7CAR-Ts that have superior CD7 binding specificity, affinity to their scFv-based counterparts, and improved proliferative capability. In this phase 1 clinical trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of nanobody-based dVHH NS7CAR-Ts for patients with CD7+ refractory/relapsed AML. A cohort of 10 patients received dVHH NS7CAR-Ts across 2 dosage levels of 5 × 105/kg and 1 × 106/kg. Before enrollment, patients had undergone a median of 8 (range, 3-17) prior lines of therapy. Seven patients had prior transplants. After NS7CAR-T infusion, 7 of 10 (70%) patients achieved complete remission (CR). The median observation time was 178 days (range, 28-776). Among 7 patients who achieved CR, 3 who relapsed from prior transplants underwent a second allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT).

One aspect of leukaemic cell resistance to chemotherapy is the development of clones with increased capacity to respond to cellular stress and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thanks in particular to a high aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) 1A1/2 activity. At diagnosis, ROS level and ALDH1A1/2 activity in AML patients BM are correlated with the different ELN 2022 prognostic groups and overall survival (OS). A significant lower ALDH1A1/2 activity in BM was observed in the favourable ELN2022 subgroup compared to the intermediate and adverse group (p < 0.01). In the same way, the ROS levels were significantly lower in the favourable ELN 2022 subgroup compared to the intermediate group (p < 0.0001) and adverse group (p < 0.0002). ROS<sup>high</sup> AML patients had a significantly lower median overall survival (OS) (8.2 months) than ROS<sup>low</sup> patients (24.6 months) (p = 0.0368). After first-line therapy, a significant increase of ROS level (p = 0.015) and ALDH1A1/2 activity (0 = 0.0273) in leukaemic blasts was observed, especially in the refractory ones.

WWP1 overexpression in AML confers a proliferative advantage to leukemic blasts (abnormal immature white blood cells) and counteracts apoptotic cell death and differentiation. In an effort to elucidate the molecular basis of WWP1 oncogenic activities, we identified WWP1 as a previously unknown negative regulator of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in AML cells. TXNIP inhibits the disulfide reductase enzymatic activity of thioredoxin (Trx), impairing its antioxidant function and, ultimately, leading to the disruption of cellular redox homeostasis. In addition, TXNIP restricts cell growth and survival by blocking glucose uptake and metabolism. Here, we found that WWP1 directly interacts with TXNIP, thus promoting its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal proteolysis. As a result, accumulation of TXNIP in response to WWP1 inactivation in AML blasts reduces Trx activity and increases ROS production, hence inducing cellular oxidative stress. Increased ROS generation in WWP1-depleted cells culminates in DNA strand breaks and subsequent apoptosis. Coherently with TXNIP stabilization following WWP1 inactivation, we also observed an impairment of both glucose up-take and consumption. Hence, a contribution to the increased cell death observed in WWP1-depleted cells also possibly arises from the attenuation of glucose up-take and glycolytic flux resulting from TXNIP accumulation. Future studies are needed to establish whether TXNIP-dependent deregulation of redox homeostasis in WWP1-overexpressing blasts may affect the response of leukemic cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.",Journal Article,"Humans, Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Oxidation-Reduction, Carrier Proteins, Reactive Oxygen Species, Thioredoxins, Cell Line, Tumor","ListElement([StringElement('HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('ROS', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('acute myeloid leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('protein ubiquitination', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('redox homeostasis', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'RefSeq', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NM_006472.6']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'})]",RefSeq,NM_006472.6

However, identifying patients likely to respond remains a challenge, especially for those with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. We evaluated the utility of ex vivo venetoclax sensitivity testing to predict treatment responses to venetoclax-azacitidine in a prospective, multicenter, phase 2 trial. The trial recruited 104 participants with previously untreated (n = 48), R/R (n = 39), or previously treated secondary AML (sAML) (n = 17). The primary end point was complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi) rate in ex vivo sensitive trial participants during the first 3 therapy cycles. The key secondary end points included the correlations between ex vivo drug sensitivity, responses, and survival. Venetoclax sensitivity was successfully assessed in 102 of 104 participants, with results available within a median of 3 days from sampling. In previously untreated AML, ex vivo sensitivity corresponded to an 85% (34/40) CR/CRi rate, with a median overall survival (OS) of 28.7 months, compared with 5.5 months for ex vivo resistant patients (P = .002). For R/R/sAML, ex vivo sensitivity resulted in a 62% CR/CRi rate (21/34) and median OS of 9.7 vs 3.3 months for ex vivo resistant patients (P < .001). In univariate and multivariate analysis, ex vivo venetoclax sensitivity was the strongest predictor for a favorable treatment response and survival.

CAR T cells targeting CD123<sup>+</sup> cells were successfully manufactured in 90.4% of runs.

Three individuals achieved clinical response (25%, 90% confidence interval 0.07-0.53). We found that myeloid-supporting cytokines are secreted during cell therapy and support AML blast survival via kinase signaling, leading to CAR T cell exhaustion. The prosurvival effect of therapy-induced cytokines presents a unique resistance mechanism in AML that is distinct from any observed in B cell malignancies. Our findings suggest that autologous CART manufacturing is feasible in AML, but treatment is associated with high rates of cytokine release syndrome and relatively poor clinical efficacy.

This pooled analysis of the phase 3 VIALE-A trial (NCT02993523) and phase 1b study (NCT02203773) examined prognostic stratification according to the 2017 and 2022 ELN risk classifications and derived new molecular signatures differentiating venetoclax-azacitidine-treated patients based on overall survival (OS). Overall, 279 patients treated with venetoclax-azacitidine and 113 patients treated with placebo-azacitidine were analyzed. The ELN 2017 or 2022 prognostic criteria classified most patients as adverse-risk AML (60.2% and 72.8% for venetoclax-azacitidine and 65.5% and 75.2% for placebo-azacitidine, respectively). Although outcomes with venetoclax-azacitidine improved across all ELN risk groups compared with placebo-azacitidine, ELN classification systems poorly discriminated venetoclax-azacitidine outcomes. By applying a bioinformatic algorithm, new molecular signatures were derived differentiating OS outcomes with venetoclax-azacitidine. The mutational status of TP53, FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), NRAS, and KRAS categorized patients into higher-, intermediate-, and lower-benefit groups (52%, 25%, and 23% of patients, respectively), each associated with a distinct median OS (26.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 20.2-32.7]; 12.1 months [95% CI, 7.3-15.2]; and 5.5 months [95% CI, 2.8-7.6], respectively). ELN prognostic classifiers did not provide clinically meaningful risk stratification of OS outcomes in patients treated with venetoclax-azacitidine.

However, it is not known whether ""niche anchoring"" of LSC affects disease evolution. To address this issue, we conditionally inactivated the adhesion molecule JAM-C (Junctional Adhesion Molecule-C) expressed by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and LSCs in an inducible mixed-lineage leukemia (iMLL)-AF9-driven AML mouse model. Deletion of Jam3 (encoding JAM-C) before induction of the leukemia-initiating iMLL-AF9 fusion resulted in a shift from long-term to short-term HSC expansion, without affecting disease initiation and progression. In vitro experiments showed that JAM-C controlled leukemic cell nesting irrespective of the bone marrow stromal cells used. RNA sequencing performed on leukemic HSCs isolated from diseased mice revealed that genes upregulated in Jam3-deficient animals belonged to activation protein-1 (AP-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)/NF-κB pathways. Human orthologs of dysregulated genes allowed to identify a score that was distinct from, and complementary to, the LSC-17 score. Substratification of patients with AML using LSC-17 and AP-1/TNF-α genes signature defined 4 groups with median survival ranging from <1 year to a median of ""not reached"" after 8 years. Finally, coculture experiments showed that AP-1 activation in leukemic cells was dependent on the nature of stromal cells. Altogether, our results identify the AP-1/TNF-α gene signature as a proxy of LSC anchoring in bone marrow niches, which improves the prognostic value of the LSC-17 score.

JNJ-75276617 (bleximenib) is a novel, orally bioavailable, potent, and selective protein-protein interaction inhibitor of the binding between menin and KMT2A. In KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r) and NPM1-mutant (NPM1c) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, JNJ-75276617 inhibited the association of the menin-KMT2A complex with chromatin at target gene promoters, resulting in reduced expression of several menin-KMT2A target genes, including MEIS1 and FLT3. JNJ-75276617 displayed potent antiproliferative activity across several AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines and patient samples harboring KMT2A or NPM1 alterations in vitro. In xenograft models of AML and ALL, JNJ-75276617 reduced leukemic burden and provided a significant dose-dependent survival benefit accompanied by expression changes of menin-KMT2A target genes.

Benchmarking of NGS-MRD taking into account other molecular MRD strategies has to be done. Here, we performed error-corrected-NGS-MRD in 189 patients homogeneously treated in the ALFA-0702 study (NCT00932412). Persistence of non-DTA mutations (HR = 2.23 for RFS and 2.26 for OS), and DTA mutations (HR = 2.16 for OS) were associated with poorer prognosis in multivariate analysis. Persistence of at least two mutations in complete remission (CR) was associated with a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (HR = 3.71, p < 0.0001), lower RFS (HR = 3.36, p < 0.0001) and OS (HR = 3.81, p = 0.00023) whereas persistence of only one mutation was not. In 100 analyzable patients, WT1-MRD, but not NGS-MRD, was an independent factor for RFS and OS. In the subset of 67 NPM1 mutated patients, both NPM1 mutation detection (p = 0.0059) and NGS-MRD (p = 0.035) status were associated with CIR.

HRQoL was a secondary end point, and it was assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) in conjunction with its elderly module (EORTC QLQ-ELD14).

HRQoL was assessed at baseline, at regeneration from cycle 2, and at 6 and 12 months after randomization, and also before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and 100 days after transplantation. Overall, 606 patients underwent randomization. At 2 months, the risk of HRQoL deterioration was lower in the DEC arm than in the 3+7 arm; 76% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69-82) vs 88% (95% CI, 82-93); odds ratio, 0.43 (95% CI, 0.24-0.76; P = .003).

This study (NCT03941964) evaluated the efficacy and safety of venetoclax plus HMA in a United States community-based outpatient setting in patients with ND AML (N = 60) who were treatment naïve for AML, ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy, had no evidence of spontaneous TLS at screening, and were deemed as appropriate candidates for outpatient initiation of venetoclax plus HMA by the investigator. Patients received venetoclax in combination with azacitidine (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or decitabine (20 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) for up to 6 cycles during the study. With a median time on study of 18.3 weeks, the best response rate of composite complete remission was 66.7%, and the overall post-baseline red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusion independence rate was 55.0%, consistent with results of studies in which treatment was initiated in an inpatient setting. Key adverse events included nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and white blood cell count decrease of any grade (≥50% of patients). The observed safety profile was generally consistent with that of venetoclax plus HMA observed in inpatient AML studies.

This multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03719534) aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of haplo-cord HCT in AML patients. A total of 268 eligible patients aged 18-60 years, diagnosed with measurable residual disease in AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia), with available haploidentical donors and suitable for allotransplantation, were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive haplo-cord HCT (n = 134) or haplo-HCT (n = 134).

Our training set included 306 adults on Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology studies with de novo CN-AML aged < 60 years who achieved a complete remission and for whom centrally reviewed cytogenetics, RNA-sequencing, and gene mutation data from diagnostic samples were available (Alliance trial A152010). To overcome deficiencies of the Cox proportional hazards model when long-term survivors are present, we developed a penalized semi-parametric mixture cure model (MCM) to predict RFS where RNA-sequencing data comprised the predictor space. To validate model performance, we employed an independent test set from the German Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cooperative Group (AMLCG) consisting of 40 de novo CN-AML patients aged < 60 years who achieved a complete remission and had RNA-sequencing of their pre-treatment sample. For the training set, there was a significant non-zero cure fraction (p = 0.019) with 28.5% of patients estimated to be cured.

The disease is driven by leukemic stem cells (LSCs), which are characterized by clonal heterogeneity and resistance to conventional therapy. These cells are therefore believed to be a major cause of progression and relapse. We designed MP0533, a multispecific CD3-engaging designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) that can simultaneously bind to three antigens on AML cells (CD33, CD123, and CD70), aiming to enable avidity-driven T cell-mediated killing of AML cells coexpressing at least two of the antigens. In vitro, MP0533 induced selective T cell-mediated killing of AML cell lines, as well as patient-derived AML blasts and LSCs, expressing two or more target antigens, while sparing healthy HSCs, blood, and endothelial cells. The higher selectivity also resulted in markedly lower levels of cytokine release in normal human blood compared to single antigen-targeting T-cell engagers. In xenograft AML mice models, MP0533 induced tumor-localized T-cell activation and cytokine release, leading to complete eradication of the tumors while having no systemic adverse effects. These studies show that the multispecific-targeting strategy used with MP0533 holds promise for improved selectivity toward LSCs and efficacy against clonal heterogeneity, potentially bringing a new therapeutic option to this group of patients with a high unmet need.

We analyzed previously published AML relapse cohorts and found that 40% of relapses occur without changes in driver mutations, suggesting that non-genetic mechanisms drive relapse in a large proportion of cases. We therefore characterized epigenetic patterns of AML relapse using 26 matched diagnosis-relapse samples with ATAC-seq. This analysis identified a relapse-specific chromatin accessibility signature for mutationally stable AML, suggesting that AML undergoes epigenetic evolution at relapse independent of mutational changes. Analysis of leukemia stem cell (LSC) chromatin changes at relapse indicated that this leukemic compartment underwent significantly less epigenetic evolution than non-LSCs, while epigenetic changes in non-LSCs reflected overall evolution of the bulk leukemia. Finally, we used single-cell ATAC-seq paired with mitochondrial sequencing (mtscATAC) to map clones from diagnosis into relapse along with their epigenetic features. We found that distinct mitochondrially-defined clones exhibit more similar chromatin accessibility at relapse relative to diagnosis, demonstrating convergent epigenetic evolution in relapsed AML. These results demonstrate that epigenetic evolution is a feature of relapsed AML and that convergent epigenetic evolution can occur following treatment with induction chemotherapy.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Humans, Epigenesis, Genetic, Recurrence, Mutation, Evolution, Molecular, Chromatin, Neoplastic Stem Cells","ListElement([StringElement('acute myeloid leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cancer biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('epigenetics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('genetics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('genomics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('human', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('relapse', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE256495', 'GSE74912', 'GSE139369']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'})]",GEO,GSE256495

Studies on the incidence and clinical features of DS are limited in this setting, and diagnosis is challenging because of nonspecific symptoms. This study assessed the incidence, diagnostic criteria, risk factors, and correlation with clinical response of DS based on the pooled analysis of 4 clinical trials in patients with IDH2-mutated AML treated with enasidenib as monotherapy, or in combination with azacitidine or with chemotherapy. Across the total AML population, 67 of 643 (10.4%) had ≥1 any-grade DS event, with highest incidence in patients who received enasidenib plus azacitidine and lowest incidence in patients who received enasidenib plus chemotherapy (13/74 [17.6%] and 2/93 [2.2%]). The most common symptoms of DS were dyspnea/hypoxia (80.6%) and pulmonary infiltrate (73.1%). Median time to onset of first DS event across all studies was 32 days (range, 4-129). Most patients (88.1%) received systemic steroids for treatment of DS. Evaluation of baseline risk factors for DS identified higher levels of bone marrow blasts and lactate dehydrogenase as independent factors associated with increased grade 3 to 5 DS risk. Overall, these results suggest that DS associated with IDH inhibition is manageable, given the benefits of enasidenib treatment in IDH2-mutated AML. We further characterized enasidenib-related DS in these patients and identified risk factors, which could be used for DS management in clinical practice.

It is effective against most FLT3 activating mutations, and, unlike other inhibitors, is minimally vulnerable to resistance induced by FLT3 ligand. We conducted a phase 1 dose escalation study of oral FF-10101 in patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML, the majority of whom harbored FLT3-activating mutations and/or had prior exposure to FLT3 inhibitors.

Based on these data, we hypothesized that an induction regimen using epigenetic priming with decitabine, followed by cytarabine would be effective and safe in older patients with previously untreated AML. Here, we conducted a phase 2 trial in which older patients with previously untreated AML received an induction regimen consisting of 1 or 2 courses of decitabine 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously (IV) for 5 days followed by cytarabine 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> continuous IV infusion for 5 days.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can contribute to MDS progression and mediate resistance to anti-PD1 therapy. As histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) decrease MDSCs in preclinical models, we conducted an investigator-initiated, NCI-Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program-sponsored, multicenter, dose escalation, and expansion phase Ib trial (NCT02936752) of the HDACi entinostat and the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab. Twenty-eight patients (25 MDS and 3 AML) were enrolled. During dose escalation (n=13 patients), there was one dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) on dose level (DL) 1 (G5 pneumonia/bronchoalveolar hemorrhage) and two DLTs at DL 2 (G3 pharyngeal mucositis and G3 anorexia). Per the 3 + 3 dose escalation design, DL 1 (entinostat 8 mg PO days 1 and 15 + pembrolizumab 200 mg IV day 1 every 21 days) was expanded and another 15 patients were enrolled. Hematologic adverse events (AEs) were common. The most common non-hematologic ≥G3 AEs were infection (32%), hypoxia/respiratory failure (11%), and dyspnea (11%). There were no protocol-defined responses among the 28 patients enrolled. Two patients achieved a marrow complete remission (mCR). Using a systems immunology approach with mass cytometry and machine learning analysis, mCR patients had increased classical monocytes and macrophages but there was no significant change of MDSCs.

We recently launched a longitudinal natural history study for patients with FPDMM. Among 27 families with research genomic data by the end of 2021, 26 different germline RUNX1 variants were detected. Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively. In 25 of 51 (49%) patients without hematologic malignancy, somatic mutations were detected in at least 1 of the clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) genes or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driver genes. BCOR was the most frequently mutated gene (in 9 patients), and multiple BCOR mutations were identified in 4 patients. Mutations in 6 other CHIP- or AML-driver genes (TET2, DNMT3A, KRAS, LRP1B, IDH1, and KMT2C) were also found in ≥2 patients without hematologic malignancy. Moreover, 3 unrelated patients (1 with myeloid malignancy) carried somatic mutations in NFE2, which regulates erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. Sequential sequencing data from 19 patients demonstrated dynamic changes of somatic mutations over time, and stable clones were more frequently found in older adult patients. In summary, there are diverse types of germline RUNX1 mutations and high frequency of somatic mutations related to clonal hematopoiesis in patients with FPDMM. Monitoring changes in somatic mutations and clinical manifestations prospectively may reveal mechanisms for malignant progression and inform clinical management.

More women were in the 2022 European LeukemiaNet intermediate-risk group and more men in adverse-risk group. We found sex differences in co-occurring mutation patterns and prognostic impact of select genetic alterations. The mutation-associated splicing events and gene-expression profiles also differed between sexes. In patients aged <60 years, SF3B1 mutations were male-specific adverse outcome prognosticators.

Here, by investigating the function of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF1α and HIF2α, we found that both genes exert oncogenic functions in AML and that HIF2α is a novel regulator of the AML differentiation block. Mechanistically, we found that HIF2α promotes the expression of transcriptional repressors that have been implicated in suppressing AML myeloid differentiation programs. Importantly, we positioned HIF2α under direct transcriptional control by the prodifferentiation agent all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and demonstrated that HIF2α blockade cooperates with ATRA to trigger AML cell differentiation.

However, accurate quantitative detection of FLT3-ITD mutations remains challenging. To identify a novel biomarker in NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> AML patients for more accurate stratification, we analysed the differential gene expression between the NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> and NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>-</sup> groups in five public AML datasets and identified a biomarker by taking the intersection of differentially expressed genes. We validated this biomarker in bone marrow samples from NPM1<sup>+</sup> AML patients at the Peking University Institute of Haematology and analysed its prognostic significance. BCAT1 expression was higher in the NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> group than in the NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>-</sup> group in all seven cohorts. BCAT1 was able to predict the prognosis of NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> AML patients, and its predictive ability was superior to that of the FLT3-ITD allelic ratio (AR). FLT3-targeted inhibitor quizartinib reduced BCAT1 expression. BCAT1 knockdown using lentiviral vectors led to the downregulation of MYC expression. Thus, we identified BCAT1 as a novel biomarker for NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> AML patients.

MDM2 inhibitor (MDM2i) monotherapy in AML has shown modest responses in clinical trials but combining options of MDM2i with other potent AML-directed agents like cytarabine and venetoclax could improve its efficacy. We conducted a phase I clinical trial (NCT03634228) to study the safety and efficacy of milademetan (an MDM2i) with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC)±venetoclax in adult patients with relapsed refractory (R/R) or newly diagnosed (ND; unfit) TP53 wild-type AML and performed comprehensive CyTOF analyses to interrogate multiple signaling pathways, the p53-MDM2 axis and the interplay between pro/anti-apoptotic molecules to identify factors that determine response and resistance to therapy. Sixteen patients (14 R/R, 2 N/D treated secondary AML) at a median age of 70 years (range, 23-80 years) were treated in this trial. Two patients (13%) achieved an overall response (complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery). Median cycles on trial were 1 (range 1-7) and at a median follow-up of 11 months, no patients remained on active therapy. Gastrointestinal toxicity was significant and dose-limiting (50% of patients ≥ grade 3). Single-cell proteomic analysis of the leukemia compartment revealed therapy-induced proteomic alterations and potential mechanisms of adaptive response to the MDM2i combination. The response was associated with immune cell abundance and induced the proteomic profiles of leukemia cells to disrupt survival pathways and significantly reduced MCL1 and YTHDF2 to potentiate leukemic cell death. The combination of milademetan, LDAC±venetoclax led to only modest responses with recognizable gastrointestinal toxicity. Treatment-induced reduction of MCL1 and YTHDF2 in an immune-rich milieu correlate with treatment response.","Clinical Trial, Phase I, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult, Humans, Young Adult, Middle Aged, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cytarabine, Tumor Suppressor Protein p53, Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein, Proteomics, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT03634228']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase I', attributes={'UI': 'D017426'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT03634228

However, some patients are ineligible because of psychosocial barriers, such as lack of appropriate caregiver support. We hypothesized that immune checkpoint inhibition after autologous transplant might represent effective postremission therapy in such patients. We conducted a phase 2 study of autologous transplantation followed by administration of pembrolizumab (8 cycles starting day +1). Twenty patients with nonfavorable AML in complete remission were treated (median age, 64 years; CR1, 80%); 55% were non-White and adverse-risk AML was present in 40%. Treatment was well tolerated, with only 1 nonrelapse death. Immune-related adverse events occurred in 9 patients. After a median follow-up of 80 months, 14 patients remain alive, with 10 patients in continuous remission. The estimated 2-year LFS was 48.4%, which met the primary end point of 2-year LFS >25%; the 2-year overall survival (OS), nonrelapse mortality, and cumulative incidences of relapse were 68%, 5%, and 46%, respectively. In comparison with a propensity score-matched cohort group of patients with AML receiving allogeneic transplant, the 3-year OS was similar (73% vs 76%). Patients in the study had inferior LFS (51% vs 75%) but superior postrelapse survival (45% vs 14%). In conclusion, programmed cell death protein-1 blockade after autologous transplant is a safe and effective alternative postremission strategy in patients with nonfavorable risk AML who are ineligible for allogeneic transplant, a context in which there is significant unmet need.

Forty-six patients were treated in phase 1 with escalating doses of sorafenib and mitoxantrone. No maximum tolerated dose was reached, and a regimen including mitoxantrone 18 mg/m2 per day and sorafenib 400 mg twice daily was declared the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

Based on its immunomodulatory and anti-leukemic properties we considered Lenalidomide (Lena) to act synergistically with Aza/DLI to improve outcome. We, therefore, prospectively investigated tolerability and efficacy of this combination as first salvage therapy for adults with post-transplant relapse of acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Patients were scheduled for eight cycles Aza (75 mg/m2 day 1-7), Lena (2.5 or 5 mg, days 1-21) and up to three DLI with increasing T-cell dosages (0.5×106-1.5×107 cells/kg). Primary endpoint was safety, while secondary endpoints included response, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and overall survival (OS). Fifty patients with molecular (52%) or hematological (48%) relapse of myelodysplastic syndromes (n=24), acute myeloid leukemia (n=23) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=3) received a median of seven (range, 1-8) cycles including 14 patients with 2.5 mg and 36 with 5 mg Lena daily dosage. Concomitantly, 34 patients (68%) received at least one DLI. Overall response rate was 56% and 25 patients (50%) achieved complete remission being durable in 80%. Median OS was 21 months and 1-year OS rate 65% with no impact of type of or time to relapse and Lena dosages. Treatment was well tolerated indicated by febrile neutropenia being the only grade ≥3 non-hematologic adverse event in >10% of patients and modest acute (grade 2-4 24%) and chronic (moderate/severe 28%) GvHD incidences. In summary, Lena can be safely added to Aza/DLI without excess of GvHD and toxicity.

Many maternal complications, such as eclampsia and cerebrovascular accidents, occur in the postpartum period. Despite widespread use of antihypertensives during pregnancy and childbirth, there is a paucity of data on preferred medications in the postpartum period. This randomized controlled study enrolled 130 women who were started on antihypertensives. They were randomized to receive oral Labetalol(LAB, maximum 900 mg per day in three doses) or oral Amlodipine(AML, maximum 10 mg per day given in two doses). In the immediate postpartum, all women were closely monitored for neurological symptoms, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, urine output, and deep tendon reflex. The primary outcome was the time to achieve sustained blood pressure control for 12 h from the initiation of medication; secondary outcomes included side effects of both medications. Mean time to achieve sustained blood pressure control was lower in women who received AML than in those who received LAB-(mean difference 7.2 h; 38 95% CI 1.4, 12.9, p = 0.011). There were fewer severe hypertensive episodes among those with AML than in those who received LAB. However, the proportion of women who continued to require antihypertensives at discharge was higher in the AML group than in the LAB group (55.4% versus 32.3%, p = 0.008). None of the participants developed drug-related side effects.

We analyzed the impact of midostaurin in 227 FLT3mut-AML patients included in the AML-12 prospective trial for fit patients ≤70 years (#NCT04687098). Patients were divided into an early (2012-2015) and late (2016-2020) cohorts. They were uniformly treated except for the addition of midostaurin in 71% of late group patients. No differences were observed in response rates or the number of allotransplants between groups. Outcome was improved in the late period: 2-year relapse incidence decreased from 42% vs 29% in early vs late group (p = 0.024) and 2-year overall survival (OS) improved from 47% vs 61% (p = 0.042), respectively. The effect of midostaurin was evident in NPM1mut patients (n = 151), with 2-yr OS of 72% (exposed) vs 50% (naive) patients (p = 0.011) and mitigated FLT3-ITD allelic ratio prognostic value: 2-yr OS with midostaurin was 85% and 58% in low and high ratio patients (p = 0.049) vs 67% and 39% in naive patients (p = 0.005). In the wild-type NPM1 subset (n = 75), we did not observe significant differences between both study periods.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored MDS Natural History Study is a prospective cohort enrolling patients undergoing workup for suspected MDS in the setting of cytopenias. Untreated patients undergo bone marrow assessment with central histopathology review for assignment as MDS, MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with <30% blasts, or ""At-Risk."" HRQoL data are collected at enrollment, including the MDS-specific Quality of Life in Myelodysplasia Scale (QUALMS). Vulnerability is assessed with the Vulnerable Elders Survey. Baseline HRQoL scores from 449 patients with MDS, MDS/MPN, AML <30%, ICUS or At-Risk were similar among diagnoses. In MDS, HRQoL was worse for vulnerable participants (eg, mean Patent-Reported Outcomes Management Information Systems [PROMIS] Fatigue of 56.0 vs 49.5; P < .001) and those with worse prognosis (eg, mean Euroqol-5 Dimension-5 Level [EQ-5D-5L] of 73.4, 72.7, and 64.1 for low, intermediate, and high-risk disease; P = .005). Among vulnerable MDS participants, most had difficulty with prolonged physical activity (88%), such as walking a quarter mile (74%). These data suggest that cytopenias leading to MDS evaluation are associated with similar HRQoL, regardless of eventual diagnosis, but with worse HRQoL among the vulnerable. Among those with MDS, lower-risk disease was associated with better HRQoL, but the relationship was lost among the vulnerable, showing for the first time that vulnerability trumps disease risk in affecting HRQoL.

Glucuronidation is a common mechanism of drug inactivation impacting many AML therapies, e.g., cytarabine, decitabine, azacytidine and venetoclax. In AML cells, the capacity for glucuronidation arises from increased production of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) enzymes. UGT1A elevation was first observed in AML patients who relapsed after response to ribavirin, a drug used to target the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, and subsequently in patients who relapsed on cytarabine. UGT1A elevation resulted from increased expression of the sonic-hedgehog transcription factor GLI1. Vismodegib inhibited GLI1, decreased UGT1A levels, reduced glucuronidation of ribavirin and cytarabine, and re-sensitized cells to these drugs. Here, we examined if UGT1A protein levels, and thus glucuronidation activity, were targetable in humans and if this corresponded to clinical response. We conducted a phase II trial using vismodegib with ribavirin, with or without decitabine, in largely heavily pre-treated patients with high-eIF4E AML. Pre-therapy molecular assessment of patients' blasts indicated highly elevated UGT1A levels relative to healthy volunteers. Among patients with partial response, blast response or prolonged stable disease, vismodegib reduced UGT1A levels, which corresponded to effective targeting of eIF4E by ribavirin.

However, the molecular mechanisms driving these alterations remain poorly defined. Using mouse models of ALL and AML, here we show that leukemic cells turn off lymphopoiesis and erythropoiesis shortly after colonizing the bone marrow. ALL and AML cells express lymphotoxin α1β2 and activate lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) signaling in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which turns off IL7 production and prevents non-malignant lymphopoiesis. We show that the DNA damage response pathway and CXCR4 signaling promote lymphotoxin α1β2 expression in leukemic cells. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of LTβR signaling in MSCs restores lymphopoiesis but not erythropoiesis, reduces leukemic cell growth, and significantly extends the survival of transplant recipients.

To assess the impact of concurrently inducing the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis-signaling pathways in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated activity of the TRAIL receptor agonistic fusion protein eftozanermin alfa (eftoza; ABBV-621) in combination with the B-cell lymphoma protein-2 selective inhibitor venetoclax in preclinical models and human patients. Simultaneously stimulating intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis-signaling pathways with venetoclax and eftoza, respectively, enhanced their activities in AML cell lines and patient-derived ex vivo/in vivo models. Eftoza activity alone or plus venetoclax required death receptor 4/5 (DR4/DR5) expression on the plasma membrane but was independent of TP53 or FLT3-ITD status. The safety/tolerability of eftoza as monotherapy and in combination with venetoclax was demonstrated in patients with relapsed/refractory AML in a phase 1 clinical trial. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 2 of 4 (50%) patients treated with eftoza monotherapy and 18 of 23 (78%) treated with eftoza plus venetoclax. An overall response rate of 30% (7/23; 4 complete responses [CRs], 2 CRs with incomplete hematologic recovery, and 1 morphologic leukemia-free state) was reported in patients who received treatment with eftoza plus venetoclax and 67% (4/6) in patients with myoblasts positive for DR4/DR5 expression; no tumor responses were observed with eftoza monotherapy.

Recently, the ETCTN/CTEP 10026 study tested the combination of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine together with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab for AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) either after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or in the HSCT-naïve setting. Integrative transcriptome-based analysis of 304 961 individual marrow-infiltrating cells for 18 of 48 subjects treated on study revealed the strong association of response with a high baseline ratio of T to AML cells. Clinical responses were predominantly driven by decitabine-induced cytoreduction. Evidence of immune activation was only apparent after ipilimumab exposure, which altered CD4+ T-cell gene expression, in line with ongoing T-cell differentiation and increased frequency of marrow-infiltrating regulatory T cells. For post-HSCT samples, relapse could be attributed to insufficient clearing of malignant clones in progenitor cell populations. In contrast to AML/MDS bone marrow, the transcriptomes of leukemia cutis samples from patients with durable remission after ipilimumab monotherapy showed evidence of increased infiltration with antigen-experienced resident memory T cells and higher expression of CTLA-4 and FOXP3. Altogether, activity of combined decitabine and ipilimumab is impacted by cellular expression states within the microenvironmental niche of leukemic cells. The inadequate elimination of leukemic progenitors mandates urgent development of novel approaches for targeting these cell populations to generate long-lasting responses.

The SICP has been shown to improve the quality and frequency of advance care planning discussions. We adapted the SICP for delivery via telehealth to older patients with AML or MDS. We conducted a single-center qualitative study of 45 participants (25 clinicians, 15 older patients with AML or MDS, and 5 caregivers). Participants, whether clinicians, patients, or caregivers, agreed that the SICP would help older patients with AML or MDS to share their personal values with their care team. Four qualitative themes emerged from our data: (1) serious illness conversations can be conducted via telehealth, (2) older patients have limited experience using technology but are willing and able to learn, (3) patients feel that serious illness conversations will help them understand their AML or MDS diagnosis and prognosis better, and (4) serious illness conversations should be common and routine, not extraordinary.

Nevertheless, treatment failure remains a challenge, and predictive markers are needed, particularly for relapsed or refractory AML. Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing may correlate with outcomes, but its prospective predictive value remains unexplored. Here we report the results of the first stage of the prospective phase II VenEx trial evaluating the utility and predictiveness of venetoclax sensitivity testing using different cell culture conditions and cell viability assays in patients receiving venetoclax-azacitidine. Participants with de novo AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, relapsed or refractory AML, or secondary AML were included. The primary endpoint was the treatment response in participants showing ex vivo sensitivity and the key secondary endpoints were the correlation of sensitivity with responses and survival. Venetoclax sensitivity testing was successful in 38/39 participants. Experimental conditions significantly influenced the predictive accuracy. Blast-specific venetoclax sensitivity measured in conditioned medium most accurately correlated with treatment outcomes; 88% of sensitive participants achieved a treatment response. The median survival was significantly longer for participants who were ex vivo-sensitive to venetoclax (14.6 months for venetoclax-sensitive patients vs. 3.5 for venetoclax-insensitive patients, P<0.001).

RARA overexpression is an actionable target for treatment with tamibarotene, an oral potent and selective RARα agonist. Sensitivity to the RARα agonist tamibarotene was demonstrated in RARA-high but not RARA-low preclinical AML models. The combination of oral tamibarotene plus azacitidine was evaluated in a phase 2 clinical study in 51 newly diagnosed unfit patients with AML identified as RARA-positive (n = 22) or RARA-negative (n = 29) for RARA mRNA overexpression in peripheral blasts using a blood-based biomarker test. In 18 response-evaluable RARA-positive patients, complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery rate was 61%, CR rate was 50%, and time to initial composite CR was rapid at 1.2 months. Transfusion independence was attained by 72% of RARA-positive patients. In contrast, 28 response-evaluable RARA-negative patients had response rates that were consistent with azacitidine monotherapy. Tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine was well tolerated. The majority of nonhematologic adverse events were low grade and hematologic adverse events were comparable to single-agent azacitidine, demonstrating that there was no additional myelosuppression when tamibarotene was combined with azacitidine.

We also showed that alternate-day administration of IMPDH inhibitors suppressed the development of MLL-AF9-driven AML in vivo without having a devastating effect on immune function. Mechanistically, IMPDH inhibition induced overactivation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-TRAF6-NF-κB signaling and upregulation of an adhesion molecule VCAM1, which contribute to the antileukemia effect of IMPDH inhibitors. Consequently, combined treatment with IMPDH inhibitors and the TLR1/2 agonist effectively inhibited the development of MLL-fusion AML.

Outcomes are limited by leukemia relapse, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and abnormal immune reconstitution. Mocravimod (KRP203) is an oral sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator that blocks the signal required by T cells to egress from lymph nodes and other lymphoid organs. Mocravimod retains T cell effector function, a main differentiator to immunosuppressants. In preclinical models, mocravimod improves survival by maintaining graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity while reducing GVHD. In patients undergoing allo-HSCT for hematological malignancies, mocravimod is postulated to prevent GVHD by redistributing allogeneic donor T cells to lymphoid tissues while allowing a sufficient GVL effect in the lymphoid, where malignant cells usually reside. The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of mocravimod in patients undergoing allo-HSCT for hematologic malignancies. Secondary objectives were to determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of mocravimod and its active metabolite mocravimod-phosphate in this patient group, as well as to assess GVHD-free, relapse free survival at 6 months after the last treatment. In this 2-part, single- and 2-arm randomized, open-label trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of mocravimod in allo-HSCT recipients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01830010). Patients received either 1 mg or 3 mg mocravimod per day on top of standard of care GVHD prophylaxis with either cyclosporine A/methotrexate or tacrolimus/methotrexate. We found that mocravimod can be safely added to standard treatment regimens in patients with hematologic malignancies requiring allo-HSCT. Mocravimod resulted in a significant reduction of circulating lymphocyte numbers and had no negative impact on engraftment and transplantation outcomes.

Patient were assessed 8 times over 2 years. Time-dependent regression models were used. Among 692 patients that were evaluable, 46% received HCT with a 2-year survival of 58%. In unadjusted models, HCT was associated with reduced risks of mortality most of the subgroups.

Although function, social life, performance status, and depressive symptoms were better for those selected for HCT, these health advantages were lost after receiving HCT. Recipients and nonrecipients of HCT similarly ranked and expected cure as main goal of therapy, whereas physicians had greater expectations for cure than the former. Accounting for health impairments negates survival benefits from HCT for AML, suggesting that the unadjusted observed benefit is mostly owing to selection of the healthier candidates.

Thus, understanding the unique molecular changes elicited by the marrow is of critical importance toward improving therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we demonstrate that aberrant activation of oxidative phosphorylation serves to induce therapeutic resistance in FLT3 mutant human AML cells challenged with FLT3 inhibitor drugs. Importantly, our findings show that AML cells are protected from apoptosis following FLT3 inhibition due to marrow-mediated activation of ATM, which in turn upregulates oxidative phosphorylation via mTOR signaling. mTOR is required for the bone marrow stroma-dependent maintenance of protein translation, with selective polysome enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation transcripts, despite FLT3 inhibition. To investigate the therapeutic significance of this finding, we tested the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib in primary human AML xenograft models. While marrow resident AML cells were highly resistant to quizartinib alone, the addition of everolimus induced profound reduction in tumor burden and prevented relapse. Taken together, these data provide a novel mechanistic understanding of marrow-based therapeutic resistance and a promising strategy for improved treatment of FLT3 mutant AML patients.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Humans, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Everolimus, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases, Apoptosis, fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3, Cell Line, Tumor, Phosphorylation, Mutation, Tumor Microenvironment","ListElement([StringElement('AML', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('bone marrow', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cancer biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('drug resistance', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('human', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE202230', 'GSE61019']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE202230

In the current study, we characterized how acute myeloid leukemia (AML) promotes the generation of senescent-like CD8+ T cells and whether they have prognostic relevance.METHODSWe analyzed NanoString, bulk RNA-Seq and single-cell RNA-Seq data from independent clinical cohorts comprising 1,896 patients treated with chemotherapy and/or immune checkpoint blockade (ICB).ResultsWe show that senescent-like bone marrow CD8+ T cells were impaired in killing autologous AML blasts and that their proportion negatively correlated with overall survival (OS). We defined what we believe to be new immune effector dysfunction (IED) signatures using 2 gene expression profiling platforms and reported that IED scores correlated with adverse-risk molecular lesions, stemness, and poor outcomes; these scores were a more powerful predictor of OS than 2017-ELN risk or leukemia stem cell (LSC17) scores. IED expression signatures also identified an ICB-unresponsive tumor microenvironment and predicted significantly shorter OS.ConclusionThe IED scores provided improved AML-risk stratification and could facilitate the delivery of personalized immunotherapies to patients who are most likely to benefit.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov; NCT02845297.FUNDINGJohn and Lucille van Geest Foundation, Nottingham Trent University's Health &amp; Wellbeing Strategic Research Theme, NIH/NCI P01CA225618, Genentech-imCORE ML40354, Qatar National Research Fund (NPRP8-2297-3-494).","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S., Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Prognosis, Immunotherapy, Tumor Microenvironment, CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes, Immune System Diseases","ListElement([StringElement('Cancer immunotherapy', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Cellular senescence', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Hematology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Leukemias', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT02845297']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013486'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02845297

Stromal cells have been shown to support AML survival and progression through various mechanisms. Nonetheless, whether AML cells could establish beneficial metabolic interactions with stromal cells is underexplored. By using a combination of human AML cell lines and AML patient samples together with mouse stromal cells and a MLL-AF9 mouse model, here we identify a novel metabolic crosstalk between AML and stromal cells where AML cells prompt stromal cells to secrete acetate for their own consumption to feed the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and lipid biosynthesis. By performing transcriptome analysis and tracer-based metabolic NMR analysis, we observe that stromal cells present a higher rate of glycolysis when co-cultured with AML cells. We also find that acetate in stromal cells is derived from pyruvate via chemical conversion under the influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following ROS transfer from AML to stromal cells via gap junctions. Overall, we present a unique metabolic communication between AML and stromal cells and propose two different molecular targets, ACSS2 and gap junctions, that could potentially be exploited for adjuvant therapy.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Acetates, Animals, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Lipids, Mice, Pyruvates, Reactive Oxygen Species, Signal Transduction, Stromal Cells, Tumor Microenvironment","ListElement([StringElement('acute myeloid leukaemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('biochemistry', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cancer biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('chemical biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('human', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('metabolism', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('microenvironment', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('mouse', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('nuclear magnetic resonance', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE163478', 'GSE128423']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE163478

To delineate the mechanistic basis of resistance to gilteritinib, we performed targeted sequencing and scRNASeq on primary FLT3-ITD-mutated AML samples. Co-occurring mutations in RAS pathway genes were the most common genetic abnormalities, and unresponsiveness to gilteritinib was associated with increased expression of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cytokines and chemokines. In particular, we found elevated expression of the TEK-family kinase, BMX, in gilteritinib-unresponsive patients pre- and post-treatment. BMX contributed to gilteritinib resistance in FLT3-mutant cell lines in a hypoxia-dependent manner by promoting pSTAT5 signaling, and these phenotypes could be reversed with pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout. We also observed that inhibition of BMX in primary FLT3-mutated AML samples decreased chemokine secretion and enhanced the activity of gilteritinib. Collectively, these findings indicate a crucial role for microenvironment-mediated factors modulated by BMX in the escape from targeted therapy and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to restore sensitivity to gilteritinib.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Aniline Compounds, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mutation, Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, Pyrazines, Tumor Microenvironment, fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'Dryad', 'AccessionNumberList': ['10.5061/dryad.zgmsbccdc']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",Dryad,10.5061/dryad.zgmsbccdc

Comparison of plasma arsenic concentrations and toxicity between RIF and arsenic trioxide (ATO) treatment in APL may help to establish an appropriate therapeutic dose of RIF for children. From October 2018 to March 2020, 19 pediatric patients with APL treated with SCCLG-APL protocol were included, 9 in RIF group at 135 mg/kg/day orally three times daily, and 10 in ATO group at 0.16 mg/kg/day intravenously over 12 h daily. Peak and trough plasma arsenic concentrations were assayed at D1, 2, 7 and 14 of induction treatment. Urine arsenic excretions were assessed with spot urine samples and the measurements were adjusted using creatinine. Toxicities were compared between two groups. The plasma arsenic concentration reached steady state at D7 either in the RIF or ATO group, and the mean peak and trough concentrations were similar between two groups (P > 0.05), which were 0.54 μmol/L and 0.48 μmol/L in RIF group, and 0.63 μmol/L and 0.51 μmol/L in ATO group, respectively. Urine arsenic excretion rate was positively correlated with the concentration of plasma arsenic. The rates of treatment-related adverse events were similar in two groups. In conclusion, the dose of RIF at 135 mg/kg/day may be an appropriate therapeutic dose in children with APL. Urine arsenic level can be used as an indicator to estimate plasma arsenic concentration.

An unplanned, post-hoc analysis of the phase I and II datasets suggests a trend of a dose response in older but not younger patients. RNA sequencing data from patient samples reveals an age-related decline in mitochondrial gene sets. Devimistat impairs ATP synthesis and we find a correlation between mitochondrial membrane potential and sensitivity to chemotherapy. Devimistat also induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and turnover consistent with mitophagy. We find that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of mitochondrial fission or autophagy sensitizes cells to devimistat.

Baseline comutations, FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) allelic ratio and length, and treatment-emergent mutations were analyzed in patients in the ADMIRAL trial. Baseline comutations were grouped according to gene subgroups (DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation, transcription, chromatin-spliceosome, receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras signaling, TP53-aneuploidy, NPM1, DNMT3A, DNMT3A/NPM1, WT-1, and IDH1/IDH2). Across all but 1 gene subgroup (TP53-aneuploidy), higher pretransplant response rates and a trend toward longer overall survival were observed with gilteritinib vs SC. Patients with DNMT3A/NPM1 comutations who received gilteritinib had the most favorable outcomes of any molecular subgroup analyzed. Survival outcomes with gilteritinib were not adversely affected by FLT3-ITD allelic ratio, FLT3-ITD length, or multiple FLT3-ITD mutations. Among patients who relapsed on gilteritinib, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and FLT3 F691L gene mutations were the most common mutational events associated with treatment resistance. However, the occurrence of Ras/MAPK pathway gene mutations at baseline did not preclude a clinical benefit from gilteritinib.

We treated 9 pediatric/YA patients with post-HCT relapsed AML with donor ML NK cells in a phase 1 trial. Patients received fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim followed 2 weeks later by infusion of donor lymphocytes and ML NK cells from the original HCT donor.

The broader clinical implications of PTPN11 mutations in AML are still not well understood. The objective of this study was to determine which cytogenetic abnormalities and gene mutations co-occur with PTPN11 mutations and how PTPN11 mutations affect outcomes of patients treated with intensive chemotherapy. We studied 1725 patients newly diagnosed with AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) enrolled onto the Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology trials. In 140 PTPN11-mutated patient samples, PTPN11 most commonly co-occurred with mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, and TET2. PTPN11 mutations were relatively common in patients with an inv(3)(q21q26)/t(3;3)(q21;q26) and a normal karyotype but were very rare in patients with typical complex karyotype and core-binding factor AML. Mutations in the N-terminal SH2 domain of PTPN11 were associated with a higher early death rate than those in the phosphatase domain. PTPN11 mutations did not affect outcomes of NPM1-mutated patients, but these patients were less likely to have co-occurring kinase mutations (ie, FLT3-ITD), suggesting activation of overlapping signaling pathways. However, in AML patients with wild-type NPM1, PTPN11 mutations were associated with adverse patient outcomes, providing a rationale to study the biology and treatment approaches in this molecular group.

Myeloblasts were harvested before HSCT to generate the vaccine. Randomization to GVAX vs placebo (1:1) was stratified according to disease, transplant center, and conditioning. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis included tacrolimus and methotrexate. GVAX or placebo vaccination was started between day 30 and 45 if there was engraftment and no GVHD.

Adoptive therapies with allogeneic, cytokine-activated NK cells are being investigated in clinical trials. However, the optimal cytokine support after adoptive transfer to promote NK cell expansion, and persistence remains unclear. Correlative studies from 2 independent clinical trial cohorts treated with major histocompatibility complex-haploidentical NK cell therapy for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia revealed that cytokine support by systemic interleukin-15 (IL-15; N-803) resulted in reduced clinical activity, compared with IL-2. We hypothesized that the mechanism responsible was IL-15/N-803 promoting recipient CD8 T-cell activation that in turn accelerated donor NK cell rejection. This idea was supported by increased proliferating CD8+ T-cell numbers in patients treated with IL-15/N-803, compared with IL-2. Moreover, mixed lymphocyte reactions showed that IL-15/N-803 enhanced responder CD8 T-cell activation and proliferation, compared with IL-2 alone. Additionally, IL-15/N-803 accelerated the ability of responding T cells to kill stimulator-derived memory-like NK cells, demonstrating that additional IL-15 can hasten donor NK cell elimination. Thus, systemic IL-15 used to support allogeneic cell therapy may paradoxically limit their therapeutic window of opportunity and clinical activity. This study indicates that stimulating patient CD8 T-cell allo-rejection responses may critically limit allogeneic cellular therapy supported with IL-15.

Thus, overexpression of CD47 enables tumor cells to escape from immune surveillance via the blockade of phagocytic mechanisms. We report here the development and characterization of CC-90002, a humanized anti-CD47 antibody. CC-90002 is unique among previously reported anti-CD47 bivalent antibodies that it does not promote hemagglutination while maintaining high-affinity binding to CD47 and inhibition of the CD47-SIRPα interaction.

In vivo studies with MM cell line-derived xenograft models established in immunodeficient mice demonstrated significant dose-dependent antitumor activity of CC-90002. Treatment with CC-90002 significantly prolonged survival in an HL-60-disseminated AML model.
