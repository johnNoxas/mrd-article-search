40122885,Bemcentinib as monotherapy and in combination with low-dose cytarabine in acute myeloid leukemia patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy: a phase 1b/2a trial.,"Loges Sonja, Heuser Michael, Chromik Jörg, Sutamtewagul Grerk, Kapp-Schwoerer Silke, Crugnola Monica, Di Renzo Nicola, Lemoli Roberto, Mattei Daniele, Fiedler Walter, Alvarado-Valero Yesid, Ben-Batalla Isabel, Waizenegger Jonas, Rieckmann Lisa-Marie, Janning Melanie, Collienne Maike, Imbusch Charles D, Beumer Niklas, Micklem David, H Nilsson Linn, Madeleine Noëlly, McCracken Nigel, Oliva Cristina, Gorcea-Carson Claudia, Gjertsen Bjørn T",Nature communications,"{'Year': '2025', 'Month': 'Mar', 'Day': '23'}","Beyond first line, the prognosis of relapsed/refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients is poor with limited treatment options. Bemcentinib is an orally bioavailable, potent, highly selective inhibitor of AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with poor prognosis, chemotherapy resistance and decreased antitumor immune response. We report bemcentinib monotherapy and bemcentinib+low-dose cytarabine combination therapy arms from the completed BerGenBio-funded open-label Phase 1/2b trial NCT02488408 ( www.clinicaltrials.gov ), in patients unsuitable for intensive chemotherapy. The primary objective in the monotherapy arm was identification of maximum tolerated dose with secondary objectives to identify dose-limiting toxicities, safety and efficacy, and bemcentinib pharmacokinetic profile. In the combination arm, the primary objective was safety and tolerability, with efficacy and pharmacokinetics as secondary objectives. Safety and tolerability were based on standard clinical laboratory safety tests and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. Bemcentinib monotherapy (32 R/R, 2 treatment-naïve AML and 2 myelodysplasia patients) was well-tolerated and a loading/maintenance dose of 400/200 mg was selected for combination treatment, comprising 30 R/R and 6 treatment-naïve AML patients. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were cytopenia, febrile neutropenia and asymptomatic QTcF prolongation, with no grade 5 events reported. In conclusion, bemcentinib+low-dose cytarabine was safe and well tolerated.","Journal Article, Clinical Trial, Phase I, Clinical Trial, Phase II, Multicenter Study","Humans, Cytarabine, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Middle Aged, Female, Aged, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, Adult, Axl Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, Maximum Tolerated Dose, Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, Proto-Oncogene Proteins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT02488408']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase I', attributes={'UI': 'D017426'}), StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase II', attributes={'UI': 'D017427'}), StringElement('Multicenter Study', attributes={'UI': 'D016448'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02488408

However, clinical outcomes are unsatisfied for patients with intermediate/adverse cytogenetics based on European Leukemia Net (ELN) risk stratification 2022 (ELN 2022), and relapses also remain common even in patients with favorable-risk cytogenetics with measurable residual disease (MRD). There is an urgent unmet need for optimizing intensive chemotherapy regimens with novel agents, to enhance the MRD-negative rate, achieve durable remission, and improve the prognosis of AML. Preliminary results showed that adding a B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor to intensive chemotherapy could improve treatment efficacy. Sonrotoclax is a potent, selective, next-generation BCL-2 inhibitor that effectively inhibits both the wide-type BCL-2 and several BCL-2 mutants. We hypothesize that the addition of sonrotoclax to intensive chemotherapy may enhance the treatment efficacy for AML without untoward toxicity.

Tumor dependence on Mcl-1 is associated with resistance to venetoclax. Voruciclib, an oral cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor targeting CDK9, indirectly decreases Mcl-1 protein expression and synergizes with venetoclax in preclinical models. This dose escalation study evaluated voruciclib in patients with previously treated hematologic malignancies. Initially, voruciclib was administered daily, continuously, on a 28-day cycle (group 1). After 2 patients with prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation had a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of interstitial pneumonitis at 100 mg, voruciclib administration was changed to days 1 to 14 of a 28-day cycle (group 2). Forty patients, 21 with AML and 19 with B-cell malignancies, were enrolled. Patients had a median of 3 prior lines of therapy (range, 1-8). Dose escalation in group 2 was stopped at 200 mg, a dose that achieved plasma concentrations sufficient for target inhibition, without DLTs observed. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (30%), nausea (25%), anemia (22%), fatigue (22%), constipation (17%), dizziness (15%), and dyspnea (15%). In AML, 1 patient achieved a morphologic leukemia-free state, and 2 had stable disease. Voruciclib treatment led to a decrease in MCL1 messenger RNA expression, downregulation of myelocytomatosis (MYC) and NF-κB transcriptional gene sets, and reduced phosphorylation of RNA polymerase 2.

We have previously demonstrated that single-chain variable fragment (scFv)-based ""naturally selected"" CD7 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (NS7CAR-T) therapy shows significant efficacy, with a favorable safety profile in T-cell lymphoid malignancies. Here, we derived dual variable heavy-chain domain of a heavy-chain antibody (dVHH) NS7CAR-Ts that have superior CD7 binding specificity, affinity to their scFv-based counterparts, and improved proliferative capability. In this phase 1 clinical trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of nanobody-based dVHH NS7CAR-Ts for patients with CD7+ refractory/relapsed AML. A cohort of 10 patients received dVHH NS7CAR-Ts across 2 dosage levels of 5 × 105/kg and 1 × 106/kg. Before enrollment, patients had undergone a median of 8 (range, 3-17) prior lines of therapy. Seven patients had prior transplants. After NS7CAR-T infusion, 7 of 10 (70%) patients achieved complete remission (CR). The median observation time was 178 days (range, 28-776). Among 7 patients who achieved CR, 3 who relapsed from prior transplants underwent a second allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT).

One aspect of leukaemic cell resistance to chemotherapy is the development of clones with increased capacity to respond to cellular stress and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thanks in particular to a high aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) 1A1/2 activity. At diagnosis, ROS level and ALDH1A1/2 activity in AML patients BM are correlated with the different ELN 2022 prognostic groups and overall survival (OS). A significant lower ALDH1A1/2 activity in BM was observed in the favourable ELN2022 subgroup compared to the intermediate and adverse group (p < 0.01). In the same way, the ROS levels were significantly lower in the favourable ELN 2022 subgroup compared to the intermediate group (p < 0.0001) and adverse group (p < 0.0002). ROS<sup>high</sup> AML patients had a significantly lower median overall survival (OS) (8.2 months) than ROS<sup>low</sup> patients (24.6 months) (p = 0.0368). After first-line therapy, a significant increase of ROS level (p = 0.015) and ALDH1A1/2 activity (0 = 0.0273) in leukaemic blasts was observed, especially in the refractory ones.

WWP1 overexpression in AML confers a proliferative advantage to leukemic blasts (abnormal immature white blood cells) and counteracts apoptotic cell death and differentiation. In an effort to elucidate the molecular basis of WWP1 oncogenic activities, we identified WWP1 as a previously unknown negative regulator of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in AML cells. TXNIP inhibits the disulfide reductase enzymatic activity of thioredoxin (Trx), impairing its antioxidant function and, ultimately, leading to the disruption of cellular redox homeostasis. In addition, TXNIP restricts cell growth and survival by blocking glucose uptake and metabolism. Here, we found that WWP1 directly interacts with TXNIP, thus promoting its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal proteolysis. As a result, accumulation of TXNIP in response to WWP1 inactivation in AML blasts reduces Trx activity and increases ROS production, hence inducing cellular oxidative stress. Increased ROS generation in WWP1-depleted cells culminates in DNA strand breaks and subsequent apoptosis. Coherently with TXNIP stabilization following WWP1 inactivation, we also observed an impairment of both glucose up-take and consumption. Hence, a contribution to the increased cell death observed in WWP1-depleted cells also possibly arises from the attenuation of glucose up-take and glycolytic flux resulting from TXNIP accumulation. Future studies are needed to establish whether TXNIP-dependent deregulation of redox homeostasis in WWP1-overexpressing blasts may affect the response of leukemic cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.",Journal Article,"Humans, Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Oxidation-Reduction, Carrier Proteins, Reactive Oxygen Species, Thioredoxins, Cell Line, Tumor","ListElement([StringElement('HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('ROS', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('acute myeloid leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('protein ubiquitination', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('redox homeostasis', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'RefSeq', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NM_006472.6']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'})]",RefSeq,NM_006472.6

However, identifying patients likely to respond remains a challenge, especially for those with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. We evaluated the utility of ex vivo venetoclax sensitivity testing to predict treatment responses to venetoclax-azacitidine in a prospective, multicenter, phase 2 trial. The trial recruited 104 participants with previously untreated (n = 48), R/R (n = 39), or previously treated secondary AML (sAML) (n = 17). The primary end point was complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CR/CRi) rate in ex vivo sensitive trial participants during the first 3 therapy cycles. The key secondary end points included the correlations between ex vivo drug sensitivity, responses, and survival. Venetoclax sensitivity was successfully assessed in 102 of 104 participants, with results available within a median of 3 days from sampling. In previously untreated AML, ex vivo sensitivity corresponded to an 85% (34/40) CR/CRi rate, with a median overall survival (OS) of 28.7 months, compared with 5.5 months for ex vivo resistant patients (P = .002). For R/R/sAML, ex vivo sensitivity resulted in a 62% CR/CRi rate (21/34) and median OS of 9.7 vs 3.3 months for ex vivo resistant patients (P < .001). In univariate and multivariate analysis, ex vivo venetoclax sensitivity was the strongest predictor for a favorable treatment response and survival.

CAR T cells targeting CD123<sup>+</sup> cells were successfully manufactured in 90.4% of runs.

Three individuals achieved clinical response (25%, 90% confidence interval 0.07-0.53). We found that myeloid-supporting cytokines are secreted during cell therapy and support AML blast survival via kinase signaling, leading to CAR T cell exhaustion. The prosurvival effect of therapy-induced cytokines presents a unique resistance mechanism in AML that is distinct from any observed in B cell malignancies. Our findings suggest that autologous CART manufacturing is feasible in AML, but treatment is associated with high rates of cytokine release syndrome and relatively poor clinical efficacy.

This pooled analysis of the phase 3 VIALE-A trial (NCT02993523) and phase 1b study (NCT02203773) examined prognostic stratification according to the 2017 and 2022 ELN risk classifications and derived new molecular signatures differentiating venetoclax-azacitidine-treated patients based on overall survival (OS). Overall, 279 patients treated with venetoclax-azacitidine and 113 patients treated with placebo-azacitidine were analyzed. The ELN 2017 or 2022 prognostic criteria classified most patients as adverse-risk AML (60.2% and 72.8% for venetoclax-azacitidine and 65.5% and 75.2% for placebo-azacitidine, respectively). Although outcomes with venetoclax-azacitidine improved across all ELN risk groups compared with placebo-azacitidine, ELN classification systems poorly discriminated venetoclax-azacitidine outcomes. By applying a bioinformatic algorithm, new molecular signatures were derived differentiating OS outcomes with venetoclax-azacitidine. The mutational status of TP53, FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), NRAS, and KRAS categorized patients into higher-, intermediate-, and lower-benefit groups (52%, 25%, and 23% of patients, respectively), each associated with a distinct median OS (26.5 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 20.2-32.7]; 12.1 months [95% CI, 7.3-15.2]; and 5.5 months [95% CI, 2.8-7.6], respectively). ELN prognostic classifiers did not provide clinically meaningful risk stratification of OS outcomes in patients treated with venetoclax-azacitidine.

However, it is not known whether ""niche anchoring"" of LSC affects disease evolution. To address this issue, we conditionally inactivated the adhesion molecule JAM-C (Junctional Adhesion Molecule-C) expressed by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and LSCs in an inducible mixed-lineage leukemia (iMLL)-AF9-driven AML mouse model. Deletion of Jam3 (encoding JAM-C) before induction of the leukemia-initiating iMLL-AF9 fusion resulted in a shift from long-term to short-term HSC expansion, without affecting disease initiation and progression. In vitro experiments showed that JAM-C controlled leukemic cell nesting irrespective of the bone marrow stromal cells used. RNA sequencing performed on leukemic HSCs isolated from diseased mice revealed that genes upregulated in Jam3-deficient animals belonged to activation protein-1 (AP-1) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)/NF-κB pathways. Human orthologs of dysregulated genes allowed to identify a score that was distinct from, and complementary to, the LSC-17 score. Substratification of patients with AML using LSC-17 and AP-1/TNF-α genes signature defined 4 groups with median survival ranging from <1 year to a median of ""not reached"" after 8 years. Finally, coculture experiments showed that AP-1 activation in leukemic cells was dependent on the nature of stromal cells. Altogether, our results identify the AP-1/TNF-α gene signature as a proxy of LSC anchoring in bone marrow niches, which improves the prognostic value of the LSC-17 score.

JNJ-75276617 (bleximenib) is a novel, orally bioavailable, potent, and selective protein-protein interaction inhibitor of the binding between menin and KMT2A. In KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r) and NPM1-mutant (NPM1c) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, JNJ-75276617 inhibited the association of the menin-KMT2A complex with chromatin at target gene promoters, resulting in reduced expression of several menin-KMT2A target genes, including MEIS1 and FLT3. JNJ-75276617 displayed potent antiproliferative activity across several AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines and patient samples harboring KMT2A or NPM1 alterations in vitro. In xenograft models of AML and ALL, JNJ-75276617 reduced leukemic burden and provided a significant dose-dependent survival benefit accompanied by expression changes of menin-KMT2A target genes.

Benchmarking of NGS-MRD taking into account other molecular MRD strategies has to be done. Here, we performed error-corrected-NGS-MRD in 189 patients homogeneously treated in the ALFA-0702 study (NCT00932412). Persistence of non-DTA mutations (HR = 2.23 for RFS and 2.26 for OS), and DTA mutations (HR = 2.16 for OS) were associated with poorer prognosis in multivariate analysis. Persistence of at least two mutations in complete remission (CR) was associated with a higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) (HR = 3.71, p < 0.0001), lower RFS (HR = 3.36, p < 0.0001) and OS (HR = 3.81, p = 0.00023) whereas persistence of only one mutation was not. In 100 analyzable patients, WT1-MRD, but not NGS-MRD, was an independent factor for RFS and OS. In the subset of 67 NPM1 mutated patients, both NPM1 mutation detection (p = 0.0059) and NGS-MRD (p = 0.035) status were associated with CIR.

HRQoL was a secondary end point, and it was assessed with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) in conjunction with its elderly module (EORTC QLQ-ELD14).

HRQoL was assessed at baseline, at regeneration from cycle 2, and at 6 and 12 months after randomization, and also before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) and 100 days after transplantation. Overall, 606 patients underwent randomization. At 2 months, the risk of HRQoL deterioration was lower in the DEC arm than in the 3+7 arm; 76% (95% confidence interval [CI], 69-82) vs 88% (95% CI, 82-93); odds ratio, 0.43 (95% CI, 0.24-0.76; P = .003).

This study (NCT03941964) evaluated the efficacy and safety of venetoclax plus HMA in a United States community-based outpatient setting in patients with ND AML (N = 60) who were treatment naïve for AML, ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy, had no evidence of spontaneous TLS at screening, and were deemed as appropriate candidates for outpatient initiation of venetoclax plus HMA by the investigator. Patients received venetoclax in combination with azacitidine (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) or decitabine (20 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) for up to 6 cycles during the study. With a median time on study of 18.3 weeks, the best response rate of composite complete remission was 66.7%, and the overall post-baseline red blood cell (RBC) and platelet transfusion independence rate was 55.0%, consistent with results of studies in which treatment was initiated in an inpatient setting. Key adverse events included nausea, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and white blood cell count decrease of any grade (≥50% of patients). The observed safety profile was generally consistent with that of venetoclax plus HMA observed in inpatient AML studies.

This multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03719534) aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of haplo-cord HCT in AML patients. A total of 268 eligible patients aged 18-60 years, diagnosed with measurable residual disease in AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia), with available haploidentical donors and suitable for allotransplantation, were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive haplo-cord HCT (n = 134) or haplo-HCT (n = 134).

Our training set included 306 adults on Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology studies with de novo CN-AML aged < 60 years who achieved a complete remission and for whom centrally reviewed cytogenetics, RNA-sequencing, and gene mutation data from diagnostic samples were available (Alliance trial A152010). To overcome deficiencies of the Cox proportional hazards model when long-term survivors are present, we developed a penalized semi-parametric mixture cure model (MCM) to predict RFS where RNA-sequencing data comprised the predictor space. To validate model performance, we employed an independent test set from the German Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cooperative Group (AMLCG) consisting of 40 de novo CN-AML patients aged < 60 years who achieved a complete remission and had RNA-sequencing of their pre-treatment sample. For the training set, there was a significant non-zero cure fraction (p = 0.019) with 28.5% of patients estimated to be cured.

The disease is driven by leukemic stem cells (LSCs), which are characterized by clonal heterogeneity and resistance to conventional therapy. These cells are therefore believed to be a major cause of progression and relapse. We designed MP0533, a multispecific CD3-engaging designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) that can simultaneously bind to three antigens on AML cells (CD33, CD123, and CD70), aiming to enable avidity-driven T cell-mediated killing of AML cells coexpressing at least two of the antigens. In vitro, MP0533 induced selective T cell-mediated killing of AML cell lines, as well as patient-derived AML blasts and LSCs, expressing two or more target antigens, while sparing healthy HSCs, blood, and endothelial cells. The higher selectivity also resulted in markedly lower levels of cytokine release in normal human blood compared to single antigen-targeting T-cell engagers. In xenograft AML mice models, MP0533 induced tumor-localized T-cell activation and cytokine release, leading to complete eradication of the tumors while having no systemic adverse effects. These studies show that the multispecific-targeting strategy used with MP0533 holds promise for improved selectivity toward LSCs and efficacy against clonal heterogeneity, potentially bringing a new therapeutic option to this group of patients with a high unmet need.

We analyzed previously published AML relapse cohorts and found that 40% of relapses occur without changes in driver mutations, suggesting that non-genetic mechanisms drive relapse in a large proportion of cases. We therefore characterized epigenetic patterns of AML relapse using 26 matched diagnosis-relapse samples with ATAC-seq. This analysis identified a relapse-specific chromatin accessibility signature for mutationally stable AML, suggesting that AML undergoes epigenetic evolution at relapse independent of mutational changes. Analysis of leukemia stem cell (LSC) chromatin changes at relapse indicated that this leukemic compartment underwent significantly less epigenetic evolution than non-LSCs, while epigenetic changes in non-LSCs reflected overall evolution of the bulk leukemia. Finally, we used single-cell ATAC-seq paired with mitochondrial sequencing (mtscATAC) to map clones from diagnosis into relapse along with their epigenetic features. We found that distinct mitochondrially-defined clones exhibit more similar chromatin accessibility at relapse relative to diagnosis, demonstrating convergent epigenetic evolution in relapsed AML. These results demonstrate that epigenetic evolution is a feature of relapsed AML and that convergent epigenetic evolution can occur following treatment with induction chemotherapy.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Humans, Epigenesis, Genetic, Recurrence, Mutation, Evolution, Molecular, Chromatin, Neoplastic Stem Cells","ListElement([StringElement('acute myeloid leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cancer biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('epigenetics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('genetics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('genomics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('human', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('relapse', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE256495', 'GSE74912', 'GSE139369']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'})]",GEO,GSE256495

Studies on the incidence and clinical features of DS are limited in this setting, and diagnosis is challenging because of nonspecific symptoms. This study assessed the incidence, diagnostic criteria, risk factors, and correlation with clinical response of DS based on the pooled analysis of 4 clinical trials in patients with IDH2-mutated AML treated with enasidenib as monotherapy, or in combination with azacitidine or with chemotherapy. Across the total AML population, 67 of 643 (10.4%) had ≥1 any-grade DS event, with highest incidence in patients who received enasidenib plus azacitidine and lowest incidence in patients who received enasidenib plus chemotherapy (13/74 [17.6%] and 2/93 [2.2%]). The most common symptoms of DS were dyspnea/hypoxia (80.6%) and pulmonary infiltrate (73.1%). Median time to onset of first DS event across all studies was 32 days (range, 4-129). Most patients (88.1%) received systemic steroids for treatment of DS. Evaluation of baseline risk factors for DS identified higher levels of bone marrow blasts and lactate dehydrogenase as independent factors associated with increased grade 3 to 5 DS risk. Overall, these results suggest that DS associated with IDH inhibition is manageable, given the benefits of enasidenib treatment in IDH2-mutated AML. We further characterized enasidenib-related DS in these patients and identified risk factors, which could be used for DS management in clinical practice.

It is effective against most FLT3 activating mutations, and, unlike other inhibitors, is minimally vulnerable to resistance induced by FLT3 ligand. We conducted a phase 1 dose escalation study of oral FF-10101 in patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML, the majority of whom harbored FLT3-activating mutations and/or had prior exposure to FLT3 inhibitors.

Based on these data, we hypothesized that an induction regimen using epigenetic priming with decitabine, followed by cytarabine would be effective and safe in older patients with previously untreated AML. Here, we conducted a phase 2 trial in which older patients with previously untreated AML received an induction regimen consisting of 1 or 2 courses of decitabine 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenously (IV) for 5 days followed by cytarabine 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> continuous IV infusion for 5 days.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can contribute to MDS progression and mediate resistance to anti-PD1 therapy. As histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) decrease MDSCs in preclinical models, we conducted an investigator-initiated, NCI-Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program-sponsored, multicenter, dose escalation, and expansion phase Ib trial (NCT02936752) of the HDACi entinostat and the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab. Twenty-eight patients (25 MDS and 3 AML) were enrolled. During dose escalation (n=13 patients), there was one dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) on dose level (DL) 1 (G5 pneumonia/bronchoalveolar hemorrhage) and two DLTs at DL 2 (G3 pharyngeal mucositis and G3 anorexia). Per the 3 + 3 dose escalation design, DL 1 (entinostat 8 mg PO days 1 and 15 + pembrolizumab 200 mg IV day 1 every 21 days) was expanded and another 15 patients were enrolled. Hematologic adverse events (AEs) were common. The most common non-hematologic ≥G3 AEs were infection (32%), hypoxia/respiratory failure (11%), and dyspnea (11%). There were no protocol-defined responses among the 28 patients enrolled. Two patients achieved a marrow complete remission (mCR). Using a systems immunology approach with mass cytometry and machine learning analysis, mCR patients had increased classical monocytes and macrophages but there was no significant change of MDSCs.

We recently launched a longitudinal natural history study for patients with FPDMM. Among 27 families with research genomic data by the end of 2021, 26 different germline RUNX1 variants were detected. Besides missense mutations enriched in Runt homology domain and loss-of-function mutations distributed throughout the gene, splice-region mutations and large deletions were detected in 6 and 7 families, respectively. In 25 of 51 (49%) patients without hematologic malignancy, somatic mutations were detected in at least 1 of the clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) genes or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) driver genes. BCOR was the most frequently mutated gene (in 9 patients), and multiple BCOR mutations were identified in 4 patients. Mutations in 6 other CHIP- or AML-driver genes (TET2, DNMT3A, KRAS, LRP1B, IDH1, and KMT2C) were also found in ≥2 patients without hematologic malignancy. Moreover, 3 unrelated patients (1 with myeloid malignancy) carried somatic mutations in NFE2, which regulates erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. Sequential sequencing data from 19 patients demonstrated dynamic changes of somatic mutations over time, and stable clones were more frequently found in older adult patients. In summary, there are diverse types of germline RUNX1 mutations and high frequency of somatic mutations related to clonal hematopoiesis in patients with FPDMM. Monitoring changes in somatic mutations and clinical manifestations prospectively may reveal mechanisms for malignant progression and inform clinical management.

More women were in the 2022 European LeukemiaNet intermediate-risk group and more men in adverse-risk group. We found sex differences in co-occurring mutation patterns and prognostic impact of select genetic alterations. The mutation-associated splicing events and gene-expression profiles also differed between sexes. In patients aged <60 years, SF3B1 mutations were male-specific adverse outcome prognosticators.

Here, by investigating the function of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF1α and HIF2α, we found that both genes exert oncogenic functions in AML and that HIF2α is a novel regulator of the AML differentiation block. Mechanistically, we found that HIF2α promotes the expression of transcriptional repressors that have been implicated in suppressing AML myeloid differentiation programs. Importantly, we positioned HIF2α under direct transcriptional control by the prodifferentiation agent all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and demonstrated that HIF2α blockade cooperates with ATRA to trigger AML cell differentiation.

However, accurate quantitative detection of FLT3-ITD mutations remains challenging. To identify a novel biomarker in NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> AML patients for more accurate stratification, we analysed the differential gene expression between the NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> and NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>-</sup> groups in five public AML datasets and identified a biomarker by taking the intersection of differentially expressed genes. We validated this biomarker in bone marrow samples from NPM1<sup>+</sup> AML patients at the Peking University Institute of Haematology and analysed its prognostic significance. BCAT1 expression was higher in the NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> group than in the NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>-</sup> group in all seven cohorts. BCAT1 was able to predict the prognosis of NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> AML patients, and its predictive ability was superior to that of the FLT3-ITD allelic ratio (AR). FLT3-targeted inhibitor quizartinib reduced BCAT1 expression. BCAT1 knockdown using lentiviral vectors led to the downregulation of MYC expression. Thus, we identified BCAT1 as a novel biomarker for NPM1<sup>+</sup> FLT3-ITD<sup>+</sup> AML patients.

MDM2 inhibitor (MDM2i) monotherapy in AML has shown modest responses in clinical trials but combining options of MDM2i with other potent AML-directed agents like cytarabine and venetoclax could improve its efficacy. We conducted a phase I clinical trial (NCT03634228) to study the safety and efficacy of milademetan (an MDM2i) with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC)±venetoclax in adult patients with relapsed refractory (R/R) or newly diagnosed (ND; unfit) TP53 wild-type AML and performed comprehensive CyTOF analyses to interrogate multiple signaling pathways, the p53-MDM2 axis and the interplay between pro/anti-apoptotic molecules to identify factors that determine response and resistance to therapy. Sixteen patients (14 R/R, 2 N/D treated secondary AML) at a median age of 70 years (range, 23-80 years) were treated in this trial. Two patients (13%) achieved an overall response (complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery). Median cycles on trial were 1 (range 1-7) and at a median follow-up of 11 months, no patients remained on active therapy. Gastrointestinal toxicity was significant and dose-limiting (50% of patients ≥ grade 3). Single-cell proteomic analysis of the leukemia compartment revealed therapy-induced proteomic alterations and potential mechanisms of adaptive response to the MDM2i combination. The response was associated with immune cell abundance and induced the proteomic profiles of leukemia cells to disrupt survival pathways and significantly reduced MCL1 and YTHDF2 to potentiate leukemic cell death. The combination of milademetan, LDAC±venetoclax led to only modest responses with recognizable gastrointestinal toxicity. Treatment-induced reduction of MCL1 and YTHDF2 in an immune-rich milieu correlate with treatment response.","Clinical Trial, Phase I, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult, Humans, Young Adult, Middle Aged, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Cytarabine, Tumor Suppressor Protein p53, Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein, Proteomics, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT03634228']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase I', attributes={'UI': 'D017426'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT03634228

However, some patients are ineligible because of psychosocial barriers, such as lack of appropriate caregiver support. We hypothesized that immune checkpoint inhibition after autologous transplant might represent effective postremission therapy in such patients. We conducted a phase 2 study of autologous transplantation followed by administration of pembrolizumab (8 cycles starting day +1). Twenty patients with nonfavorable AML in complete remission were treated (median age, 64 years; CR1, 80%); 55% were non-White and adverse-risk AML was present in 40%. Treatment was well tolerated, with only 1 nonrelapse death. Immune-related adverse events occurred in 9 patients. After a median follow-up of 80 months, 14 patients remain alive, with 10 patients in continuous remission. The estimated 2-year LFS was 48.4%, which met the primary end point of 2-year LFS >25%; the 2-year overall survival (OS), nonrelapse mortality, and cumulative incidences of relapse were 68%, 5%, and 46%, respectively. In comparison with a propensity score-matched cohort group of patients with AML receiving allogeneic transplant, the 3-year OS was similar (73% vs 76%). Patients in the study had inferior LFS (51% vs 75%) but superior postrelapse survival (45% vs 14%). In conclusion, programmed cell death protein-1 blockade after autologous transplant is a safe and effective alternative postremission strategy in patients with nonfavorable risk AML who are ineligible for allogeneic transplant, a context in which there is significant unmet need.

Forty-six patients were treated in phase 1 with escalating doses of sorafenib and mitoxantrone. No maximum tolerated dose was reached, and a regimen including mitoxantrone 18 mg/m2 per day and sorafenib 400 mg twice daily was declared the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

Based on its immunomodulatory and anti-leukemic properties we considered Lenalidomide (Lena) to act synergistically with Aza/DLI to improve outcome. We, therefore, prospectively investigated tolerability and efficacy of this combination as first salvage therapy for adults with post-transplant relapse of acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Patients were scheduled for eight cycles Aza (75 mg/m2 day 1-7), Lena (2.5 or 5 mg, days 1-21) and up to three DLI with increasing T-cell dosages (0.5×106-1.5×107 cells/kg). Primary endpoint was safety, while secondary endpoints included response, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and overall survival (OS). Fifty patients with molecular (52%) or hematological (48%) relapse of myelodysplastic syndromes (n=24), acute myeloid leukemia (n=23) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n=3) received a median of seven (range, 1-8) cycles including 14 patients with 2.5 mg and 36 with 5 mg Lena daily dosage. Concomitantly, 34 patients (68%) received at least one DLI. Overall response rate was 56% and 25 patients (50%) achieved complete remission being durable in 80%. Median OS was 21 months and 1-year OS rate 65% with no impact of type of or time to relapse and Lena dosages. Treatment was well tolerated indicated by febrile neutropenia being the only grade ≥3 non-hematologic adverse event in >10% of patients and modest acute (grade 2-4 24%) and chronic (moderate/severe 28%) GvHD incidences. In summary, Lena can be safely added to Aza/DLI without excess of GvHD and toxicity.

Many maternal complications, such as eclampsia and cerebrovascular accidents, occur in the postpartum period. Despite widespread use of antihypertensives during pregnancy and childbirth, there is a paucity of data on preferred medications in the postpartum period. This randomized controlled study enrolled 130 women who were started on antihypertensives. They were randomized to receive oral Labetalol(LAB, maximum 900 mg per day in three doses) or oral Amlodipine(AML, maximum 10 mg per day given in two doses). In the immediate postpartum, all women were closely monitored for neurological symptoms, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, urine output, and deep tendon reflex. The primary outcome was the time to achieve sustained blood pressure control for 12 h from the initiation of medication; secondary outcomes included side effects of both medications. Mean time to achieve sustained blood pressure control was lower in women who received AML than in those who received LAB-(mean difference 7.2 h; 38 95% CI 1.4, 12.9, p = 0.011). There were fewer severe hypertensive episodes among those with AML than in those who received LAB. However, the proportion of women who continued to require antihypertensives at discharge was higher in the AML group than in the LAB group (55.4% versus 32.3%, p = 0.008). None of the participants developed drug-related side effects.

We analyzed the impact of midostaurin in 227 FLT3mut-AML patients included in the AML-12 prospective trial for fit patients ≤70 years (#NCT04687098). Patients were divided into an early (2012-2015) and late (2016-2020) cohorts. They were uniformly treated except for the addition of midostaurin in 71% of late group patients. No differences were observed in response rates or the number of allotransplants between groups. Outcome was improved in the late period: 2-year relapse incidence decreased from 42% vs 29% in early vs late group (p = 0.024) and 2-year overall survival (OS) improved from 47% vs 61% (p = 0.042), respectively. The effect of midostaurin was evident in NPM1mut patients (n = 151), with 2-yr OS of 72% (exposed) vs 50% (naive) patients (p = 0.011) and mitigated FLT3-ITD allelic ratio prognostic value: 2-yr OS with midostaurin was 85% and 58% in low and high ratio patients (p = 0.049) vs 67% and 39% in naive patients (p = 0.005). In the wild-type NPM1 subset (n = 75), we did not observe significant differences between both study periods.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-sponsored MDS Natural History Study is a prospective cohort enrolling patients undergoing workup for suspected MDS in the setting of cytopenias. Untreated patients undergo bone marrow assessment with central histopathology review for assignment as MDS, MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with <30% blasts, or ""At-Risk."" HRQoL data are collected at enrollment, including the MDS-specific Quality of Life in Myelodysplasia Scale (QUALMS). Vulnerability is assessed with the Vulnerable Elders Survey. Baseline HRQoL scores from 449 patients with MDS, MDS/MPN, AML <30%, ICUS or At-Risk were similar among diagnoses. In MDS, HRQoL was worse for vulnerable participants (eg, mean Patent-Reported Outcomes Management Information Systems [PROMIS] Fatigue of 56.0 vs 49.5; P < .001) and those with worse prognosis (eg, mean Euroqol-5 Dimension-5 Level [EQ-5D-5L] of 73.4, 72.7, and 64.1 for low, intermediate, and high-risk disease; P = .005). Among vulnerable MDS participants, most had difficulty with prolonged physical activity (88%), such as walking a quarter mile (74%). These data suggest that cytopenias leading to MDS evaluation are associated with similar HRQoL, regardless of eventual diagnosis, but with worse HRQoL among the vulnerable. Among those with MDS, lower-risk disease was associated with better HRQoL, but the relationship was lost among the vulnerable, showing for the first time that vulnerability trumps disease risk in affecting HRQoL.

Glucuronidation is a common mechanism of drug inactivation impacting many AML therapies, e.g., cytarabine, decitabine, azacytidine and venetoclax. In AML cells, the capacity for glucuronidation arises from increased production of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) enzymes. UGT1A elevation was first observed in AML patients who relapsed after response to ribavirin, a drug used to target the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E, and subsequently in patients who relapsed on cytarabine. UGT1A elevation resulted from increased expression of the sonic-hedgehog transcription factor GLI1. Vismodegib inhibited GLI1, decreased UGT1A levels, reduced glucuronidation of ribavirin and cytarabine, and re-sensitized cells to these drugs. Here, we examined if UGT1A protein levels, and thus glucuronidation activity, were targetable in humans and if this corresponded to clinical response. We conducted a phase II trial using vismodegib with ribavirin, with or without decitabine, in largely heavily pre-treated patients with high-eIF4E AML. Pre-therapy molecular assessment of patients' blasts indicated highly elevated UGT1A levels relative to healthy volunteers. Among patients with partial response, blast response or prolonged stable disease, vismodegib reduced UGT1A levels, which corresponded to effective targeting of eIF4E by ribavirin.

However, the molecular mechanisms driving these alterations remain poorly defined. Using mouse models of ALL and AML, here we show that leukemic cells turn off lymphopoiesis and erythropoiesis shortly after colonizing the bone marrow. ALL and AML cells express lymphotoxin α1β2 and activate lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTβR) signaling in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which turns off IL7 production and prevents non-malignant lymphopoiesis. We show that the DNA damage response pathway and CXCR4 signaling promote lymphotoxin α1β2 expression in leukemic cells. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of LTβR signaling in MSCs restores lymphopoiesis but not erythropoiesis, reduces leukemic cell growth, and significantly extends the survival of transplant recipients.

To assess the impact of concurrently inducing the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis-signaling pathways in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated activity of the TRAIL receptor agonistic fusion protein eftozanermin alfa (eftoza; ABBV-621) in combination with the B-cell lymphoma protein-2 selective inhibitor venetoclax in preclinical models and human patients. Simultaneously stimulating intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis-signaling pathways with venetoclax and eftoza, respectively, enhanced their activities in AML cell lines and patient-derived ex vivo/in vivo models. Eftoza activity alone or plus venetoclax required death receptor 4/5 (DR4/DR5) expression on the plasma membrane but was independent of TP53 or FLT3-ITD status. The safety/tolerability of eftoza as monotherapy and in combination with venetoclax was demonstrated in patients with relapsed/refractory AML in a phase 1 clinical trial. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 2 of 4 (50%) patients treated with eftoza monotherapy and 18 of 23 (78%) treated with eftoza plus venetoclax. An overall response rate of 30% (7/23; 4 complete responses [CRs], 2 CRs with incomplete hematologic recovery, and 1 morphologic leukemia-free state) was reported in patients who received treatment with eftoza plus venetoclax and 67% (4/6) in patients with myoblasts positive for DR4/DR5 expression; no tumor responses were observed with eftoza monotherapy.

Recently, the ETCTN/CTEP 10026 study tested the combination of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine together with the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipilimumab for AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) either after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or in the HSCT-naïve setting. Integrative transcriptome-based analysis of 304 961 individual marrow-infiltrating cells for 18 of 48 subjects treated on study revealed the strong association of response with a high baseline ratio of T to AML cells. Clinical responses were predominantly driven by decitabine-induced cytoreduction. Evidence of immune activation was only apparent after ipilimumab exposure, which altered CD4+ T-cell gene expression, in line with ongoing T-cell differentiation and increased frequency of marrow-infiltrating regulatory T cells. For post-HSCT samples, relapse could be attributed to insufficient clearing of malignant clones in progenitor cell populations. In contrast to AML/MDS bone marrow, the transcriptomes of leukemia cutis samples from patients with durable remission after ipilimumab monotherapy showed evidence of increased infiltration with antigen-experienced resident memory T cells and higher expression of CTLA-4 and FOXP3. Altogether, activity of combined decitabine and ipilimumab is impacted by cellular expression states within the microenvironmental niche of leukemic cells. The inadequate elimination of leukemic progenitors mandates urgent development of novel approaches for targeting these cell populations to generate long-lasting responses.

The SICP has been shown to improve the quality and frequency of advance care planning discussions. We adapted the SICP for delivery via telehealth to older patients with AML or MDS. We conducted a single-center qualitative study of 45 participants (25 clinicians, 15 older patients with AML or MDS, and 5 caregivers). Participants, whether clinicians, patients, or caregivers, agreed that the SICP would help older patients with AML or MDS to share their personal values with their care team. Four qualitative themes emerged from our data: (1) serious illness conversations can be conducted via telehealth, (2) older patients have limited experience using technology but are willing and able to learn, (3) patients feel that serious illness conversations will help them understand their AML or MDS diagnosis and prognosis better, and (4) serious illness conversations should be common and routine, not extraordinary.

Nevertheless, treatment failure remains a challenge, and predictive markers are needed, particularly for relapsed or refractory AML. Ex vivo drug sensitivity testing may correlate with outcomes, but its prospective predictive value remains unexplored. Here we report the results of the first stage of the prospective phase II VenEx trial evaluating the utility and predictiveness of venetoclax sensitivity testing using different cell culture conditions and cell viability assays in patients receiving venetoclax-azacitidine. Participants with de novo AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy, relapsed or refractory AML, or secondary AML were included. The primary endpoint was the treatment response in participants showing ex vivo sensitivity and the key secondary endpoints were the correlation of sensitivity with responses and survival. Venetoclax sensitivity testing was successful in 38/39 participants. Experimental conditions significantly influenced the predictive accuracy. Blast-specific venetoclax sensitivity measured in conditioned medium most accurately correlated with treatment outcomes; 88% of sensitive participants achieved a treatment response. The median survival was significantly longer for participants who were ex vivo-sensitive to venetoclax (14.6 months for venetoclax-sensitive patients vs. 3.5 for venetoclax-insensitive patients, P<0.001).

RARA overexpression is an actionable target for treatment with tamibarotene, an oral potent and selective RARα agonist. Sensitivity to the RARα agonist tamibarotene was demonstrated in RARA-high but not RARA-low preclinical AML models. The combination of oral tamibarotene plus azacitidine was evaluated in a phase 2 clinical study in 51 newly diagnosed unfit patients with AML identified as RARA-positive (n = 22) or RARA-negative (n = 29) for RARA mRNA overexpression in peripheral blasts using a blood-based biomarker test. In 18 response-evaluable RARA-positive patients, complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery rate was 61%, CR rate was 50%, and time to initial composite CR was rapid at 1.2 months. Transfusion independence was attained by 72% of RARA-positive patients. In contrast, 28 response-evaluable RARA-negative patients had response rates that were consistent with azacitidine monotherapy. Tamibarotene in combination with azacitidine was well tolerated. The majority of nonhematologic adverse events were low grade and hematologic adverse events were comparable to single-agent azacitidine, demonstrating that there was no additional myelosuppression when tamibarotene was combined with azacitidine.

We also showed that alternate-day administration of IMPDH inhibitors suppressed the development of MLL-AF9-driven AML in vivo without having a devastating effect on immune function. Mechanistically, IMPDH inhibition induced overactivation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-TRAF6-NF-κB signaling and upregulation of an adhesion molecule VCAM1, which contribute to the antileukemia effect of IMPDH inhibitors. Consequently, combined treatment with IMPDH inhibitors and the TLR1/2 agonist effectively inhibited the development of MLL-fusion AML.

Improved financial crime compliance processes and systems enable anti-ML (AML) analysts to devote considerable time and effort to case investigation and process quality work, thereby lowering financial risks by reporting suspicious activity in a timely and effective manner. This study uses Job Characteristics Theory (JCT) to evaluate the AML system through the job satisfaction and motivation of its users. The purpose of this study is to determine how satisfied AML personnel are with their jobs and how motivated they are to work with the system. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional study used JCT to investigate the important elements impacting employee satisfaction with the AML system. The five core dimensions of the job characteristics were measured using a job diagnostic survey. The respondents were employees working in the AML department of a Malaysian bank, and the sample group was chosen using a purposive sampling approach. A total of 100 acceptable replies were gathered and analysed using various statistical approaches. A motivating potential score was generated for each employee based on five main job characteristics. <b>Results:</b> Findings revealed that five core job characteristics, namely, skill diversity, task identity, task importance, autonomy and feedback, positively influence the AML system employees' job satisfaction. However, skill variety and autonomy are found to be low, which are reflected in the poor motivating potential score. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study examined the characteristics of the AML system and its users' job satisfaction.

Outcomes are limited by leukemia relapse, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and abnormal immune reconstitution. Mocravimod (KRP203) is an oral sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) modulator that blocks the signal required by T cells to egress from lymph nodes and other lymphoid organs. Mocravimod retains T cell effector function, a main differentiator to immunosuppressants. In preclinical models, mocravimod improves survival by maintaining graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity while reducing GVHD. In patients undergoing allo-HSCT for hematological malignancies, mocravimod is postulated to prevent GVHD by redistributing allogeneic donor T cells to lymphoid tissues while allowing a sufficient GVL effect in the lymphoid, where malignant cells usually reside. The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of mocravimod in patients undergoing allo-HSCT for hematologic malignancies. Secondary objectives were to determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of mocravimod and its active metabolite mocravimod-phosphate in this patient group, as well as to assess GVHD-free, relapse free survival at 6 months after the last treatment. In this 2-part, single- and 2-arm randomized, open-label trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of mocravimod in allo-HSCT recipients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01830010). Patients received either 1 mg or 3 mg mocravimod per day on top of standard of care GVHD prophylaxis with either cyclosporine A/methotrexate or tacrolimus/methotrexate. We found that mocravimod can be safely added to standard treatment regimens in patients with hematologic malignancies requiring allo-HSCT. Mocravimod resulted in a significant reduction of circulating lymphocyte numbers and had no negative impact on engraftment and transplantation outcomes.

Patient were assessed 8 times over 2 years. Time-dependent regression models were used. Among 692 patients that were evaluable, 46% received HCT with a 2-year survival of 58%. In unadjusted models, HCT was associated with reduced risks of mortality most of the subgroups.

Although function, social life, performance status, and depressive symptoms were better for those selected for HCT, these health advantages were lost after receiving HCT. Recipients and nonrecipients of HCT similarly ranked and expected cure as main goal of therapy, whereas physicians had greater expectations for cure than the former. Accounting for health impairments negates survival benefits from HCT for AML, suggesting that the unadjusted observed benefit is mostly owing to selection of the healthier candidates.

Thus, understanding the unique molecular changes elicited by the marrow is of critical importance toward improving therapeutic outcomes. In this study, we demonstrate that aberrant activation of oxidative phosphorylation serves to induce therapeutic resistance in FLT3 mutant human AML cells challenged with FLT3 inhibitor drugs. Importantly, our findings show that AML cells are protected from apoptosis following FLT3 inhibition due to marrow-mediated activation of ATM, which in turn upregulates oxidative phosphorylation via mTOR signaling. mTOR is required for the bone marrow stroma-dependent maintenance of protein translation, with selective polysome enrichment of oxidative phosphorylation transcripts, despite FLT3 inhibition. To investigate the therapeutic significance of this finding, we tested the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in combination with the FLT3 inhibitor quizartinib in primary human AML xenograft models. While marrow resident AML cells were highly resistant to quizartinib alone, the addition of everolimus induced profound reduction in tumor burden and prevented relapse.

The IDH2 inhibitor enasidenib was recently approved for IDH2-mutated relapsed or refractory AML. We conducted a multi-center, phase I trial of maintenance enasidenib following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with IDH2-mutated myeloid malignancies. Two dose levels, 50mg and 100mg daily were studied in a 3 × 3 dose-escalation design, with 10 additional patients treated at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Enasidenib was initiated between days 30 and 90 following HCT and continued for twelve 28-day cycles. Twenty-three patients were enrolled, of whom 19 initiated post-HCT maintenance. Two had myelodysplastic syndrome, and 17 had AML. All but 3 were in first complete remission. No dose limiting toxicities were observed, and the RP2D was established at 100mg daily. Attributable grade ≥3 toxicities were rare, with the most common being cytopenias. Eight patients stopped maintenance before completing 12 cycles, due to adverse events (n=3), pursuing treatment for graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) (n=2), clinician choice (n=1), relapse (n=1), and COVID infection (n=1). No cases of grade ≥3 acute GVHD were seen, and 12-month cumulative incidence of moderate/severe chronic GVHD was 42% (20-63%). Cumulative incidence of relapse was 16% (95% CI: 3.7-36%); 1 subject relapsed while receiving maintenance. Two-year progression-free and overall survival were 69% (95% CI: 39-86%) and 74% (95% CI, 44-90%), respectively. Enasidenib is safe, well-tolerated, with preliminary activity as maintenance therapy following HCT, and merits additional study.

We defined what we believe to be new immune effector dysfunction (IED) signatures using 2 gene expression profiling platforms and reported that IED scores correlated with adverse-risk molecular lesions, stemness, and poor outcomes; these scores were a more powerful predictor of OS than 2017-ELN risk or leukemia stem cell (LSC17) scores.

Stromal cells have been shown to support AML survival and progression through various mechanisms. Nonetheless, whether AML cells could establish beneficial metabolic interactions with stromal cells is underexplored. By using a combination of human AML cell lines and AML patient samples together with mouse stromal cells and a MLL-AF9 mouse model, here we identify a novel metabolic crosstalk between AML and stromal cells where AML cells prompt stromal cells to secrete acetate for their own consumption to feed the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and lipid biosynthesis. By performing transcriptome analysis and tracer-based metabolic NMR analysis, we observe that stromal cells present a higher rate of glycolysis when co-cultured with AML cells. We also find that acetate in stromal cells is derived from pyruvate via chemical conversion under the influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following ROS transfer from AML to stromal cells via gap junctions. Overall, we present a unique metabolic communication between AML and stromal cells and propose two different molecular targets, ACSS2 and gap junctions, that could potentially be exploited for adjuvant therapy.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Acetates, Animals, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Lipids, Mice, Pyruvates, Reactive Oxygen Species, Signal Transduction, Stromal Cells, Tumor Microenvironment","ListElement([StringElement('acute myeloid leukaemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('biochemistry', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cancer biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('chemical biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('human', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('metabolism', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('microenvironment', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('mouse', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('nuclear magnetic resonance', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE163478', 'GSE128423']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE163478

To delineate the mechanistic basis of resistance to gilteritinib, we performed targeted sequencing and scRNASeq on primary FLT3-ITD-mutated AML samples. Co-occurring mutations in RAS pathway genes were the most common genetic abnormalities, and unresponsiveness to gilteritinib was associated with increased expression of bone marrow-derived hematopoietic cytokines and chemokines. In particular, we found elevated expression of the TEK-family kinase, BMX, in gilteritinib-unresponsive patients pre- and post-treatment. BMX contributed to gilteritinib resistance in FLT3-mutant cell lines in a hypoxia-dependent manner by promoting pSTAT5 signaling, and these phenotypes could be reversed with pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout. We also observed that inhibition of BMX in primary FLT3-mutated AML samples decreased chemokine secretion and enhanced the activity of gilteritinib. Collectively, these findings indicate a crucial role for microenvironment-mediated factors modulated by BMX in the escape from targeted therapy and have implications for the development of novel therapeutic interventions to restore sensitivity to gilteritinib.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Aniline Compounds, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mutation, Protein-Tyrosine Kinases, Pyrazines, Tumor Microenvironment, fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'Dryad', 'AccessionNumberList': ['10.5061/dryad.zgmsbccdc']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",Dryad,10.5061/dryad.zgmsbccdc

Comparison of plasma arsenic concentrations and toxicity between RIF and arsenic trioxide (ATO) treatment in APL may help to establish an appropriate therapeutic dose of RIF for children. From October 2018 to March 2020, 19 pediatric patients with APL treated with SCCLG-APL protocol were included, 9 in RIF group at 135 mg/kg/day orally three times daily, and 10 in ATO group at 0.16 mg/kg/day intravenously over 12 h daily. Peak and trough plasma arsenic concentrations were assayed at D1, 2, 7 and 14 of induction treatment. Urine arsenic excretions were assessed with spot urine samples and the measurements were adjusted using creatinine. Toxicities were compared between two groups. The plasma arsenic concentration reached steady state at D7 either in the RIF or ATO group, and the mean peak and trough concentrations were similar between two groups (P > 0.05), which were 0.54 μmol/L and 0.48 μmol/L in RIF group, and 0.63 μmol/L and 0.51 μmol/L in ATO group, respectively. Urine arsenic excretion rate was positively correlated with the concentration of plasma arsenic. The rates of treatment-related adverse events were similar in two groups. In conclusion, the dose of RIF at 135 mg/kg/day may be an appropriate therapeutic dose in children with APL. Urine arsenic level can be used as an indicator to estimate plasma arsenic concentration.

Twenty-three adult patients with very high/high/intermediate-risk AML or MDS were enrolled in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. All 23 patients experienced at least one grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse event. One patient in the combination cohort reported a dose-limiting toxicity. Eighteen patients discontinued treatment; in nine patients, discontinuation was due to progressive disease. Three patients died on study of causes considered unrelated to study drugs. Pevonedistat exhibited linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 10-44 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, with minimal accumulation following multiple-dose administration. An objective response was achieved by 5/11 (45%) response-evaluable patients in the pevonedistat plus azacitidine arm (all with AML), and 0 in the single-agent pevonedistat arm.

An unplanned, post-hoc analysis of the phase I and II datasets suggests a trend of a dose response in older but not younger patients. RNA sequencing data from patient samples reveals an age-related decline in mitochondrial gene sets. Devimistat impairs ATP synthesis and we find a correlation between mitochondrial membrane potential and sensitivity to chemotherapy. Devimistat also induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and turnover consistent with mitophagy. We find that pharmacological or genetic inhibition of mitochondrial fission or autophagy sensitizes cells to devimistat.

Baseline comutations, FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) allelic ratio and length, and treatment-emergent mutations were analyzed in patients in the ADMIRAL trial. Baseline comutations were grouped according to gene subgroups (DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation, transcription, chromatin-spliceosome, receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras signaling, TP53-aneuploidy, NPM1, DNMT3A, DNMT3A/NPM1, WT-1, and IDH1/IDH2). Across all but 1 gene subgroup (TP53-aneuploidy), higher pretransplant response rates and a trend toward longer overall survival were observed with gilteritinib vs SC. Patients with DNMT3A/NPM1 comutations who received gilteritinib had the most favorable outcomes of any molecular subgroup analyzed. Survival outcomes with gilteritinib were not adversely affected by FLT3-ITD allelic ratio, FLT3-ITD length, or multiple FLT3-ITD mutations. Among patients who relapsed on gilteritinib, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and FLT3 F691L gene mutations were the most common mutational events associated with treatment resistance. However, the occurrence of Ras/MAPK pathway gene mutations at baseline did not preclude a clinical benefit from gilteritinib.

Here we provide a follow-up of the ADMIRAL trial 2 years after the primary analysis to clarify the long-term treatment effects and safety of gilteritinib in these patients with AML. At the time of this analysis, the median survival follow-up was 37.1 months, with deaths in 203 of 247 and 97 of 124 patients in the gilteritinib and SC arms, respectively; 16 gilteritinib-treated patients remained on treatment. The median overall survival for the gilteritinib and SC arms was 9.3 and 5.6 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.665; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.518, 0.853; two-sided P = .0013); 2-year estimated survival rates were 20.6% (95% CI, 15.8, 26.0) and 14.2% (95% CI, 8.3, 21.6). The gilteritinib-arm 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse after composite complete remission was 75.7%, with few relapses occurring after 18 months. Overall, 49 of 247 patients in the gilteritinib arm and 14 of 124 patients in the SC arm were alive for ≥2 years. Twenty-six gilteritinib-treated patients remained alive for ≥2 years without relapse; 18 of these patients underwent transplantation (hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) and 16 restarted gilteritinib as post-HSCT maintenance therapy. The most common adverse events of interest during years 1 and 2 of gilteritinib therapy were increased liver transaminase levels; adverse event incidence decreased in year 2. Thus, continued and post-HSCT gilteritinib maintenance treatment sustained remission with a stable safety profile.

TCRαβ/CD19 depletion may reduce this risk, whereas maintaining graft-versus-leukemia. Outcome data with TCRαβ/CD19 depletion generally describe haploidentical donors, with relatively few URDs. We hypothesized that TCRαβ/CD19-depletion would attenuate the risks of GVHD and relapse for URD HSCT. Sixty pediatric and young adult (YA) patients with hematologic malignancies who lacked a matched-related donor were enrolled at 2 large pediatric transplantation centers between October 2014 and September 2019. All patients with acute leukemia had minimal residual disease testing, and DP typing was available for 77%. All patients received myeloablative total body irradiation- or busulfan-based conditioning with no posttransplant immune suppression. Engraftment occurred in 98%. Four-year overall survival was 69% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52%-81%), and leukemia-free survival was 64% (95% CI, 48%-76%), with no difference between lymphoid and myeloid malignancies (P = .6297 and P = .5441, respectively). One patient (1.7%) experienced primary graft failure. Relapse occurred in 11 patients (3-year cumulative incidence, 21%; 95% CI, 11-34), and 8 patients (cumulative incidence, 15%; 95% CI, 6.7-26) experienced nonrelapse mortality.

We treated 9 pediatric/YA patients with post-HCT relapsed AML with donor ML NK cells in a phase 1 trial. Patients received fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim followed 2 weeks later by infusion of donor lymphocytes and ML NK cells from the original HCT donor.

The objective of this study was to determine which cytogenetic abnormalities and gene mutations co-occur with PTPN11 mutations and how PTPN11 mutations affect outcomes of patients treated with intensive chemotherapy. We studied 1725 patients newly diagnosed with AML (excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia) enrolled onto the Cancer and Leukemia Group B/Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology trials. In 140 PTPN11-mutated patient samples, PTPN11 most commonly co-occurred with mutations in NPM1, DNMT3A, and TET2. PTPN11 mutations were relatively common in patients with an inv(3)(q21q26)/t(3;3)(q21;q26) and a normal karyotype but were very rare in patients with typical complex karyotype and core-binding factor AML. Mutations in the N-terminal SH2 domain of PTPN11 were associated with a higher early death rate than those in the phosphatase domain. PTPN11 mutations did not affect outcomes of NPM1-mutated patients, but these patients were less likely to have co-occurring kinase mutations (ie, FLT3-ITD), suggesting activation of overlapping signaling pathways.

Adoptive therapies with allogeneic, cytokine-activated NK cells are being investigated in clinical trials. However, the optimal cytokine support after adoptive transfer to promote NK cell expansion, and persistence remains unclear. Correlative studies from 2 independent clinical trial cohorts treated with major histocompatibility complex-haploidentical NK cell therapy for relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia revealed that cytokine support by systemic interleukin-15 (IL-15; N-803) resulted in reduced clinical activity, compared with IL-2. We hypothesized that the mechanism responsible was IL-15/N-803 promoting recipient CD8 T-cell activation that in turn accelerated donor NK cell rejection. This idea was supported by increased proliferating CD8+ T-cell numbers in patients treated with IL-15/N-803, compared with IL-2. Moreover, mixed lymphocyte reactions showed that IL-15/N-803 enhanced responder CD8 T-cell activation and proliferation, compared with IL-2 alone. Additionally, IL-15/N-803 accelerated the ability of responding T cells to kill stimulator-derived memory-like NK cells, demonstrating that additional IL-15 can hasten donor NK cell elimination. Thus, systemic IL-15 used to support allogeneic cell therapy may paradoxically limit their therapeutic window of opportunity and clinical activity.

We designed a synthetic experiment simulating response kinetics of 5,000 patients to compare different computational methods with respect to their ability to accurately predict relapse for chronic and acute myeloid leukemia treatment. Technically, we used clinical reference data to first fit a model and then generate de novo model simulations of individual patients' time courses for which we can systematically tune data quality (i.e. measurement error) and quantity (i.e. number of measurements). Based hereon, we compared the prediction accuracy of three different computational methods, namely mechanistic models, generalized linear models, and deep neural networks that have been fitted to the reference data. Reaching prediction accuracies between 60 and close to 100%, our results indicate that data quality has a higher impact on prediction accuracy than the specific choice of the particular method. We further show that adapted treatment and measurement schemes can considerably improve the prediction accuracy by 10 to 20%.

Monitoring the peripheral blood blast burden during induction by flow cytometry has shown significant value in the evaluation of treatment responses. Our previous study reported the day 5 peripheral blast clearance rate (D5-PBCR) as an indicator of early treatment response, and D5-PBCR (+) patients showed poor outcomes. We performed the present phase 2 trial of early intervention in D5-PBCR (+) patients with homoharringtonine (HHT) introduced in the traditional induction regimen with anthracycline and cytarabine. The primary endpoint was complete remission (CR). This study enrolled 151 patients, 65 patients were D5-PBCR (+) and 55 patients completed induction with HHT addition. The overall CR rate after one course of induction was 84.4%, with 87.5% and 80.0% for the D5-PBCR (-) and D5-PBCR (+) groups, respectively. The incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was comparable between the two groups. At the median follow-up of 53.1 months, median overall survival (OS) was not reached in the entire cohort, and median event-free survival (EFS) was 42.2 months. Neither the OS nor EFS showed significant differences between the D5-PBCR (-) and D5-PBCR (+) groups. Compared to historical data, significant improvements in both OS (p = .020) and EFS (p = .020) were observed in the D5-PBCR (+) group. In conclusion, optimization of induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine according to D5-PBCR is feasible in patients with newly diagnosed AML.

In preclinical studies, type 1 interferon (IFN-α) enhanced cross-presentation of leukemia-specific antigens by CD8α dendritic cells (DCs) and amplified GVL. This observation was translated into a proof-of-concept phase 1/2 clinical trial with long-acting IFN-α (pegylated IFN-α [pegIFNα]) in patients undergoing HCT for high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients with treatment-resistant AML not in remission or those with poor-risk leukemia were administered 4 dosages of pegIFNα every 14 days beginning at day -1 before HCT. Dose selection was established by adaptive design that continuously assessed the probability of dose-limiting toxicities throughout the trial. Efficacy was evaluated by determining the 6-month incidence of relapse at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Thirty-six patients (median age, 60 years) received pegIFNα treatment. Grade 3 or greater severe adverse events occurred in 25% of patients, establishing 180 μg as the MTD. In phase 2, the incidence of relapse was 39% at 6 months, which was sustained through 1-year post-HCT. The incidence of transplant-related mortality was 13%, and severe grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurred in 11%. Paired blood samples from donors and recipients after HCT revealed elevated levels of type 1 IFN with cellular response, the persistence of cross-presenting DCs, and circulating leukemia antigen-specific T cells. These data suggest that prophylactic administration of pegIFNα is feasible in the peri-HCT period.

With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease-specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders EXpanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both rare and common cells across human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells with highly similar phenotypes that localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specialized MHCII tetramer reagents that mark rhinovirus-specific CD4+ cells were left out during analysis and then used to test whether T-REX identified biologically significant cells. T-REX identified rhinovirus-specific CD4+ T cells based on phenotypically homogeneous cells expanding by ≥95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots of virus-specific T cells by comparing infection (day 7) to either pre-infection (day 0) or post-infection (day 28) samples. Plotting the direction and degree of change for each individual donor provided a useful summary view and revealed patterns of immune system behavior across immune monitoring settings. For example, the magnitude and direction of change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing a complete response to chemotherapy. Other COVID-19 patients instead displayed an immune trajectory like that seen in rhinovirus infection or checkpoint inhibitor therapy for melanoma. The T-REX algorithm thus rapidly identifies and characterizes mechanistically significant cells and places emerging diseases into a systems immunology context for comparison to well-studied immune changes.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Adolescent, Adult, Algorithms, CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes, COVID-19, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Melanoma, Neoplasms, Picornaviridae Infections, Rhinovirus, SARS-CoV-2, Unsupervised Machine Learning, Young Adult","ListElement([StringElement('COVID-19', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('computational biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cytometry', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('human', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('immune monitoring', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('immunology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('inflammation', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('machine learning', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('rhinovirus', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('systems biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT02796001']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02796001

However, classical antibody-based approaches are restricted to targeting lineage-specific cell surface antigens. By targeting intracellular antigens, a large number of other leukemia-associated targets would become accessible. In this study, we evaluated a novel T-cell bispecific (TCB) antibody, generated by using CrossMAb and knob-into-holes technology, containing a bivalent T-cell receptor-like binding domain that recognizes the RMFPNAPYL peptide derived from the intracellular tumor antigen Wilms tumor protein (WT1) in the context of HLA-A*02. Binding to CD3ε recruits T cells irrespective of their T-cell receptor specificity. WT1-TCB elicited antibody-mediated T-cell cytotoxicity against AML cell lines in a WT1- and HLA-restricted manner.

In a phase 1 study of AML patients treated with G3139, cytarabine, and daunorubicin induction with cytarabine consolidation, no antisense-related toxicity was reported, and BCL2 downregulation occurred in patients achieving complete remission. In this phase 3 trial, untreated older AML patients were randomized to cytarabine (100 mg/m2 per day on days 4-10) and daunorubicin (60 mg/m2 per day on days 4-6) followed by cytarabine consolidation (2000 mg/m2 per day on days 4-8) with (arm A) or without (arm B) G3139 (7 mg/m2 per day on days 1-10 [induction] or days 1-8 [consolidation]).

The interaction of CD47 with signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα) triggers a ""don't eat me"" signal to the macrophage, inhibiting phagocytosis. Thus, overexpression of CD47 enables tumor cells to escape from immune surveillance via the blockade of phagocytic mechanisms. We report here the development and characterization of CC-90002, a humanized anti-CD47 antibody. CC-90002 is unique among previously reported anti-CD47 bivalent antibodies that it does not promote hemagglutination while maintaining high-affinity binding to CD47 and inhibition of the CD47-SIRPα interaction. Studies in a panel of hematological cancer cell lines showed concentration-dependent CC-90002-mediated phagocytosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), lenalidomide-resistant multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines and AML cells from patients. In vivo studies with MM cell line-derived xenograft models established in immunodeficient mice demonstrated significant dose-dependent antitumor activity of CC-90002. Treatment with CC-90002 significantly prolonged survival in an HL-60-disseminated AML model. Mechanistic studies confirmed the binding of CC-90002 to tumor cells and concomitant recruitment of F4-80 positive macrophages into the tumor and an increase in expression of select chemokines and cytokines of murine origin. Furthermore, the role of macrophages in the CC-90002-mediated antitumor activity was demonstrated by transient depletion of macrophages with liposome-clodronate treatment. In non-human primates, CC-90002 displayed acceptable pharmacokinetic properties and a favorable toxicity profile.

Nevertheless, the transient suspension of the bluebird bio gene therapy trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02140554) after participants developed acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) raised concerns. Potential possibilities for these cases include busulfan, insertional mutagenesis, both, or neither. Busulfan was considered the cause in the first reported case because the transgene was not present in the AML/MDS. However, busulfan is unlikely to have contributed to the most recent case. The transgene was present in the patient's malignant cells, indicating they were infused after busulfan treatment. Several lines of evidence suggest an alternative explanation for events in the bluebird bio trial, including that SCD population studies show an increased relative, but a low absolute, risk of AML/MDS. We propose a new hypothesis: after gene therapy for SCD, the stress of switching from homeostatic to regenerative hematopoiesis by transplanted cells drives clonal expansion and leukemogenic transformation of preexisting premalignant clones, eventually resulting in AML/MDS. Evidence validating our hypothesis will support prescreening individuals with SCD for preleukemic progenitors before gene therapy. While presumed viable, safe strategy has been implemented to resume gene therapy in adults with severe SCD, reasonable alternative curative therapy should be considered for children and adults with severe SCD.

Leukemic blasts have a negative impact on NK cell function and promote the emergence of phenotypically and functionally impaired NK cells. In the current work, we highlight an accumulation of CD56<sup>-</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> unconventional NK cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), an aberrant subset initially described as being elevated in patients chronically infected with HIV-1. Deep phenotyping of NK cells was performed using peripheral blood from patients with newly diagnosed AML (<i>n</i> = 48, HEMATOBIO cohort, NCT02320656) and healthy subjects (<i>n</i> = 18) by mass cytometry. We showed evidence of a moderate to drastic accumulation of CD56<sup>-</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> unconventional NK cells in 27% of patients. These NK cells displayed decreased expression of NKG2A as well as the triggering receptors NKp30 and NKp46, in line with previous observations in HIV-infected patients. High-dimensional characterization of these NK cells highlighted a decreased expression of three additional major triggering receptors required for NK cell activation, NKG2D, DNAM-1, and CD96. A high proportion of CD56<sup>-</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells at diagnosis was associated with an adverse clinical outcome and decreased overall survival (HR = 0.13; <i>P</i> = 0.0002) and event-free survival (HR = 0.33; <i>P</i> = 0.018) and retained statistical significance in multivariate analysis. Pseudotime analysis of the NK cell compartment highlighted a disruption of the maturation process, with a bifurcation from conventional NK cells toward CD56<sup>-</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells. Overall, our data suggest that the accumulation of CD56<sup>-</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> NK cells may be the consequence of immune escape from innate immunity during AML progression.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Antigens, CD, Flow Cytometry, Humans, Immunophenotyping, Killer Cells, Natural, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Lymphocyte Activation, Remission Induction, Treatment Outcome","ListElement([StringElement('AML', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('CD56−CD16+ NK cells', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('mass cytometry', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('natural killer cells', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT02320656']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02320656

However, most patients experience relapse after allo-HSCT, with a poor prognosis, and treatment options are limited. The lack of an ideal targetable antigen is a major obstacle for treating patients with relapsed AML. CD38 is known to be expressed on most AML and myeloma cells, and its lack of expression on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) renders it a potential therapeutic target for relapsed AML. To investigate the clinical therapeutic efficacy and safety of CD38-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T-38) cells, we enrolled 6 AML patients who experienced relapse post-allo-HSCT (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04351022). Prior to CAR-T-38 treatment, the blasts in the bone marrow of these patients exhibited a median of 95% (92-99%) CD38 positivity. Four weeks after the initial infusion of CAR-T-38 cells, four of six (66.7%) patients achieved complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi); the median CR or CRi time was 191 (range 117-261) days. The cumulative relapse rate at 6 months was 50%. The median overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) times were 7.9 and 6.4 months, respectively. One case relapsed 117 days after the first CAR-T-38 cell infusion, with remission achieved after the second CAR-T-38 cell infusion. All six patients experienced clinically manageable side effects. In addition, multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) revealed that CAR-T-38 cells eliminated CD38 positive blasts without off-target effects on monocytes and lymphocytes. Although this prospective study has a limited number of cases and a relatively short follow-up time, our preliminary data highlight the clinical utility and safety of CAR-T-38 cell therapy in treating relapsed AML post-allo-HSCT.","Letter, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Humans, Immunotherapy, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Receptors, Chimeric Antigen, Transplantation Conditioning, Transplantation, Homologous","ListElement([StringElement('Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('CAR-T-38', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Chimeric antigen receptor T cells', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Cytokine release syndrome', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Relapsed acute myeloid leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT04351022']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Letter', attributes={'UI': 'D016422'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT04351022

In turn, these informed the development of Master Trial designs to test these therapies. The Beat Acute Myeloid Leukemia (BAML) Master Trial (Sponsor: The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society) tests several targeted therapies in patients aged ≥ 60 years with AML based on genomic profiling obtained within 7 days of study enrollment. We hypothesized that integrating operational strategies with new electronic technologies (e-technologies) might streamline the conduct and management of this Master Trial. BAML's 5 core operational strategies revolve around the guiding principle of ""patients first."" The e-technology platforms employed in BAML include: Clinical Oversight Platform: a central collaborative tool; e-Protocol/e-Source Upload/Electronic Data Capture Platform: digitizes the protocol, allows remote data monitoring, and collects/exports data in Study Data Tabulation Model format; and Data Review Platform: ingests data from different sources for clinical response and safety data reviews. The operational approaches, e-technologies and sponsor/contract research organization's (CRO) expertise together allow: the complexity and size of the BAML Master Trial to be better managed; near real-time study data oversight; better collaboration, communication and training; improved data collection, enhanced transmission and accessibility; data integration, review and generation of reports; while maintaining data privacy, and compliance. Initial e-technology challenges were overcome through training, learning, discipline and adjustment. In conclusion, to successfully manage Master Trials, significant time should be spent re-evaluating, improving and developing new operational approaches.Clinical Trial Registration: Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: NCT03013998. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03013998 .","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Clinical Trials as Topic, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Technology","ListElement([StringElement('Artificial intelligence', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Clinical trials', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('E-technologies', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('EDC', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('EHR-to-EDC', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Remote monitoring', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT03013998']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT03013998

In particular, low-frequency SNVs are hard to distinguish from sequencing artifacts. While the increasing availability of multi-sample tumor DNA sequencing data holds the potential for more accurate variant calling, there is a lack of high-sensitivity multi-sample SNV callers that utilize these data. Here we report Moss, a method to identify low-frequency SNVs that recur in multiple sequencing samples from the same tumor. Moss provides any existing single-sample SNV caller the ability to support multiple samples with little additional time overhead. We demonstrate that Moss improves recall while maintaining high precision in a simulated dataset. On multi-sample hepatocellular carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia and colorectal cancer datasets, Moss identifies new low-frequency variants that meet manual review criteria and are consistent with the tumor's mutational signature profile. In addition, Moss detects the presence of variants in more samples of the same tumor than reported by the single-sample caller. Moss' improved sensitivity in SNV calling will enable more detailed downstream analyses in cancer genomics.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","Algorithms, Carcinoma, Hepatocellular, Colorectal Neoplasms, DNA, Neoplasm, Gene Frequency, Genomics, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Liver Neoplasms, Mutation, Nucleotides, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'figshare', 'AccessionNumberList': ['10.6084/m9.figshare.14079953']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013486'})]",figshare,10.6084/m9.figshare.14079953

However, the utility of MRD with venetoclax-based lower intensity regimens is unknown. We analyzed the prognostic value of achieving a negative MRD in older/""unfit"" patients with AML receiving first-line therapy with 10-day decitabine and venetoclax. MRD was evaluated in bone marrow specimens using multicolor flow cytometry (sensitivity 0.1%). Ninety-seven patients achieving either a complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) or morphologic leukemia-free state were included. Median age was 72 years (interquartile range, 68-78 years), and 64% had adverse-risk AML. Eighty-three patients achieved CR/CRi, and 52 (54%) became MRD negative. Median time to becoming MRD negative was 2.0 months (interquartile range, 0.9-3.1 months). Patients becoming MRD negative by 2 months had longer relapse-free survival (RFS) compared with those remaining MRD positive (median RFS, not reached vs 5.2 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.78; P = .004), longer event-free survival (EFS) (median EFS, not reached vs 5.8 months; HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.55; P < .001), as well as longer overall survival (OS) (median OS, 25.1 vs 7.1 months; HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.11-0.51; P < .001).

ADI-PEG20 was shown to induce complete responses in ~10% of relapsed/refractory or poor-risk AML patients. We conducted a phase I, dose-escalation study combining ADI-PEG20 and low-dose cytarabine (LDC) in AML patients. Patients received 20 mg LDC subcutaneously twice daily for 10 days every 28 days and ADI-PEG20 at 18 or 36 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (dose levels 1 and 2) intramuscularly weekly. An expansion cohort for the maximal tolerated dose of ADI-PEG20 was planned to further estimate the toxicity and preliminary response of this regimen. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability. The secondary endpoints were time on treatment, overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), and biomarkers (pharmacodynamics and immunogenicity detection). Twenty-three patients were included in the study, and seventeen patients were in the expansion cohort (dose level 2). No patients developed dose-limiting toxicities. The most common grade III/IV toxicities were thrombocytopenia (61%), anemia (52%), and neutropenia (30%). One had an allergic reaction to ADI-PEG20.

Here, we show that most subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) depend on the aberrant assembly of MYB transcriptional co-activator complex. By rapid and selective peptidomimetic interference with the binding of CBP/P300 to MYB, but not CREB or MLL1, we find that the leukemic functions of MYB are mediated by CBP/P300 co-activation of a distinct set of transcription factor complexes. These MYB complexes assemble aberrantly with LYL1, E2A, C/EBP family members, LMO2, and SATB1. They are organized convergently in genetically diverse subtypes of AML and are at least in part associated with inappropriate transcription factor co-expression. Peptidomimetic remodeling of oncogenic MYB complexes is accompanied by specific proteolysis and dynamic redistribution of CBP/P300 with alternative transcription factors such as RUNX1 to induce myeloid differentiation and apoptosis. Thus, aberrant assembly and sequestration of MYB:CBP/P300 complexes provide a unifying mechanism of oncogenic gene expression in AML. This work establishes a compelling strategy for their pharmacologic reprogramming and therapeutic targeting for diverse leukemias and possibly other human cancers caused by dysregulated gene control.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Cell Line, Tumor, Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Matrix Attachment Region Binding Proteins, Oncogenes, Peptidomimetics, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb, p300-CBP Transcription Factors","ListElement([StringElement('Leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cancer biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('gene expression', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('human', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('proteomics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE163470']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE163470

After achieving complete remission with ATRA-ATO-based induction therapy, patients were randomized (1:1) into ATO and non-ATO groups for consolidation: ATRA-ATO versus ATRA-anthracycline for low-/intermediate-risk patients, or ATRA-ATO-anthracycline versus ATRA-anthracycline-cytarabine for high-risk patients. The primary end point was to assess disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 y by a noninferiority margin of -5%; 855 patients were enrolled with a median follow-up of 54.9 mo, and 658 of 755 patients could be evaluated at 3 y. In the ATO group, 96.1% (319/332) achieved 3-y DFS, compared to 92.6% (302/326) in the non-ATO group. The difference was 3.45% (95% CI -0.07 to 6.97), confirming noninferiority (<i>P</i> < 0.001).

Population pharmacokinetics (PKs; N = 253), exposure-response (efficacy [n = 201] and safety [n = 253]), and concentration-corrected electrocardiogram QT interval (QTc; n = 171) analyses were performed using phase I data (100 mg twice daily and 300-1200 mg q.d.). Ivosidenib disposition was well-described by a two-compartment PK model with first-order absorption and elimination. Between-subject variability was moderate for PK parameters. Intrinsic factors did not affect ivosidenib PKs. Moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased the area under the plasma ivosidenib concentration-time curve at steady state (AUC<sub>ss</sub> ) by 60%. Efficacy responders and nonresponders had similar ivosidenib exposures. Based on AUC<sub>ss</sub> , there was no apparent relationship between ivosidenib exposure and efficacy or adverse events. The plasma ivosidenib concentration-QT analysis showed a mean change in QTc using Fridericia's method (ΔQTcF) of 17.2 msec at the approved 500 mg q.d. dose. Because of the direct association between ivosidenib exposure and QTcF, patients should have their electrocardiograms and electrolytes monitored, and comedications that increase ivosidenib exposure or prolong the QT interval should be avoided. These model-based analyses quantitatively provide a framework to describe the relationship among ivosidenib dose, exposure, and clinical end points.

Infusion of unselected donor lymphocytes (DLIs) enhances the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. However, because the infused lymphocytes are not selected for leukemia specificity, the GVL effect is often accompanied by life-threatening graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), related to the concurrent transfer of alloreactive lymphocytes. Thus, to minimize GVHD and maximize GVL, we selectively activated and expanded stem cell donor-derived T cells reactive to multiple antigens expressed by AML/MDS cells (PRAME, WT1, Survivin, and NY-ESO-1). Products that demonstrated leukemia antigen specificity were generated from 29 HCT donors. In contrast to DLIs, leukemia-specific T cells (mLSTs) selectively recognized and killed leukemia antigen-pulsed cells, with no activity against recipient's normal cells in vitro. We administered escalating doses of mLSTs (0.5 to 10 × 107 cells per square meter) to 25 trial enrollees, 17 with high risk of relapse and 8 with relapsed disease.

The management of lower-risk (LR) MDS with persistent cytopenias remains suboptimal. Eltrombopag (EPAG), a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, can improve platelet counts in LR-MDS and tri-lineage hematopoiesis in aplastic anemia (AA). We conducted a phase 2 dose modification study to investigate the safety and efficacy of EPAG in LR-MDS. EPAG dose was escalated from 50 mg/day, to a maximum of 150 mg/day over a period of 16 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was hematologic response at 16-20 weeks. Eleven of 25 (44%) patients responded; five and six patients had uni- or bi-lineage hematologic responses, respectively. The predictors of response were presence of a PNH clone, marrow hypocellularity, thrombocytopenia with or without other cytopenia, and elevated plasma thrombopoietin levels at study entry. The safety profile was consistent with previous EPAG studies in AA; no patients discontinued drug due to adverse events. Three patients developed reversible grade-3 liver toxicity and one patient had increased reticulin fibrosis. Ten patients discontinued EPAG after achieving a robust response (median time 16 months); four of them reinitiated EPAG due to declining counts, and all attained a second robust response.

In multivariate analyses, after adjustment for ELN risk and pre-HSCT measurable residual disease status, disease origin did not impact outcomes. Within the ELN favorable risk group, CIR was higher in s/tAML compared to de novo AML patients likely due to a different distribution of genetic aberrations, which did not translate into shorter OS.

Here, we present the identification of a first-in-class GSPT1-selective cereblon E3 ligase modulator, CC-90009. Biochemical, structural, and molecular characterization demonstrates that CC-90009 coopts the CRL4CRBN to selectively target GSPT1 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Depletion of GSPT1 by CC-90009 rapidly induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) apoptosis, reducing leukemia engraftment and leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in large-scale primary patient xenografting of 35 independent AML samples, including those with adverse risk features. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen for effectors of CC-90009 response, we uncovered the ILF2 and ILF3 heterodimeric complex as a novel regulator of cereblon expression. Knockout of ILF2/ILF3 decreases the production of full-length cereblon protein via modulating CRBN messenger RNA alternative splicing, leading to diminished response to CC-90009. The screen also revealed that the mTOR signaling and the integrated stress response specifically regulate the response to CC-90009 in contrast to other cereblon modulators. Hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway by inactivation of TSC1 and TSC2 protected against the growth inhibitory effect of CC-90009 by reducing CC-90009-induced binding of GSPT1 to cereblon and subsequent GSPT1 degradation.

Between 2009 and 2017, a total of 187 patients aged 18 to 75 years were entered into a randomized controlled study of posttransplant azacitidine if they were in complete remission. Patients randomized to the treatment arm (n = 93) were scheduled to receive azacitidine, given as 32 mg/m2 per day subcutaneously for 5 days every 28 days for 12 cycles. The control arm (n = 94) had no intervention. Eighty-seven of the 93 patients started azacitidine maintenance. The median number of cycles received was 4; a total of 29 patients relapsed on study, and 23 patients withdrew from the study due to toxicity, patient's preference, or logistical reasons. Median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 2.07 years in the azacitidine group vs 1.28 years in the control group (P = .43). There was also no significant difference for overall survival, with a median of 2.52 years vs 2.56 years in the azacitidine and control groups (P = .85), respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed no improvement in RFS or overall survival with the use of azacitidine as maintenance compared with the control group (hazard ratios of 0.73 [95% confidence interval, 0.49-1.1; P = .14] and 0.84 [95% confidence interval, 0.55-1.29; P = .43]) [corrected]. This randomized trial with azacitidine maintenance showed that a prospective trial in the posttransplant setting was feasible and safe but challenging. Although RFS was comparable between the 2 arms, we believe the strategy of maintenance therapy merits further study with a goal to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with AML/MDS.

AML originates from a dominant mutation, then acquires collaborative transformative mutations leading to myeloid transformation and clinical/biological heterogeneity. Currently, AML treatment is initiated rapidly, precluding the ability to consider the mutational profile of a patient's leukemia for treatment decisions. Untreated patients with AML ≥ 60 years were prospectively enrolled on the ongoing Beat AML trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03013998 ), which aims to provide cytogenetic and mutational data within 7 days (d) from sample receipt and before treatment selection, followed by treatment assignment to a sub-study based on the dominant clone. A total of 487 patients with suspected AML were enrolled; 395 were eligible. Median age was 72 years (range 60-92 years; 38% ≥75 years); 374 patients (94.7%) had genetic and cytogenetic analysis completed within 7 d and were centrally assigned to a Beat AML sub-study; 224 (56.7%) were enrolled on a Beat AML sub-study.

Demographic, laboratory and molecular characteristics were not significantly different between patients on the Beat AML sub-studies and those receiving SOC (induction with cytarabine + daunorubicin (7 + 3 or equivalent) or hypomethylation agent). Thirty-day mortality was less frequent and overall survival was significantly longer for patients enrolled on the Beat AML sub-studies versus those who elected SOC.

Response to therapy informs risk, and morphology continues to be used more frequently than flow cytometry. Herein, the largest cohort of pediatric patients prospectively assessed for measurable residual disease (MRD) by flow cytometry (N = 784) is reported. The ""difference from normal"" (ΔN) technique was applied: 31% of all patients tested positive (AML range, 0.02% to 91%) after the first course of treatment on Children's Oncology Group study AAML0531. Detection of MRD following initial chemotherapy proved the strongest predicator of overall survival (OS) in univariable and multivariable analyses, and was predictive of relapse risk, disease-free survival, and treatment-related mortality. Clearance of MRD after a second round of chemotherapy did not improve survival. The morphologic definition of persistent disease (>15% AML) failed 27% of the time; those identified as MRD- had superior outcomes. Similarly, for patients not achieving morphologic remission (>5% blasts), 36% of patients were MRD- and had favorable outcomes compared with those who were MRD+ (P < .001); hence an increase in myeloid progenitor cells can be favorable when ΔN classifies them as phenotypically normal. Furthermore, ΔN reclassified 20% of patients in morphologic remission as having detectable MRD with comparable poor outcomes. Retrospective analysis using the relapse phenotype as a template demonstrated that 96% of MRD- patients had <0.02% of the relapse immunophenotype in their end of induction 1 marrow.

The objective of this research is to develop new statistical methods in detecting and analyzing both differentially expressed and spliced isoforms, which appropriately account for the dependence between isoforms and multiple testing corrections for the multi-dimensional structure of at both the gene- and isoform- level. We developed a linear mixed effects model-based approach for analyzing the complex alternative RNA splicing regulation patterns detected by whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing technologies. This approach thoroughly characterizes and differentiates three types of genes related to alternative RNA splicing events with distinct differential expression/splicing patterns. We applied the concept of appropriately controlling for the gene-level overall false discovery rate (OFDR) in this multi-dimensional alternative RNA splicing analysis utilizing a two-step hierarchical hypothesis testing framework. In the initial screening test we identify genes that have differentially expressed or spliced isoforms; in the subsequent confirmatory testing stage we examine only the isoforms for genes that have passed the screening tests. Comparisons with other methods through application to a whole transcriptome RNA-Seq study of adenoid cystic carcinoma and extensive simulation studies have demonstrated the advantages and improved performances of our method. Our proposed method appropriately controls the gene-level OFDR, maintains statistical power, and is flexible to incorporate advanced experimental designs.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Algorithms, Alternative Splicing, Carcinoma, Adenoid Cystic, Child, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Linear Models, Models, Genetic, RNA, Messenger, Sequence Analysis, RNA, Exome Sequencing",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'Dryad', 'AccessionNumberList': ['10.5061/dryad.66t1g1k0h']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'})]",Dryad,10.5061/dryad.66t1g1k0h

We have recently shown an association between an immune-infiltrated tumor microenvironment (TME) and resistance to cytarabine-based chemotherapy but responsiveness to flotetuzumab, a bispecific DART antibody-based molecule to CD3ε and CD123. This paper reports the results of a multicenter, open-label, phase 1/2 study of flotetuzumab in 88 adults with relapsed/refractory AML: 42 in a dose-finding segment and 46 at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of 500 ng/kg per day. The most frequent adverse events were infusion-related reactions (IRRs)/cytokine release syndrome (CRS), largely grade 1-2. Stepwise dosing during week 1, pretreatment dexamethasone, prompt use of tocilizumab, and temporary dose reductions/interruptions successfully prevented severe IRR/CRS. Clinical benefit accrued to PIF/ER patients showing an immune-infiltrated TME. Among 30 PIF/ER patients treated at the RP2D, the complete remission (CR)/CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh) rate was 26.7%, with an overall response rate (CR/CRh/CR with incomplete hematological recovery) of 30.0%.

We assessed the performance of the KB in guiding HSCT decisions in first complete remission (CR1) in 656 AML patients younger than 60 years from the ALFA-0702 trial (NCT00932412). KB predictions of overall survival (OS) were superior to those of European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 risk stratification (C-index, 68.9 vs 63.0). Among patients reaching CR1, HSCT in CR1, as a time-dependent covariate, was detrimental in those with favorable ELN 2017 risk and those with negative NPM1 minimal residual disease (MRD; interaction tests, P = .01 and P = .02, respectively). Using KB simulations of survival at 5 years in a scenario without HSCT in CR1 (KB score), we identified, in a similar time-dependent analysis, a significant interaction between KB score and HSCT, with HSCT in CR1 being detrimental only in patients with a good prognosis based on KB simulations (KB score ≥40; interaction test, P = .01). We could finally integrate ELN 2017, NPM1 MRD, and KB scores to sort 545 CR1 patients into 278 (51.0%) HSCT candidates and 267 (49.0%) chemotherapy-only candidates. In both time-dependent and 6-month landmark analyses, HSCT significantly improved OS in HSCT candidates, whereas it significantly shortened OS in chemotherapy-only candidates. Integrating KB predictions with ELN 2017 and MRD may thus represent a promising approach to optimize HSCT timing in younger AML patients.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adolescent, Adult, Algorithms, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, Clinical Decision-Making, Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic, Combined Modality Therapy, Datasets as Topic, Female, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Middle Aged, Models, Theoretical, Multicenter Studies as Topic, Neoplasm, Residual, Nuclear Proteins, Nucleophosmin, Precision Medicine, Prognosis, Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic, Remission Induction, Risk Assessment, Transplantation, Homologous, Young Adult",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT00932412']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT00932412

However, in the absence of these features, uncertainties remain to identify the secondary nature of some cases otherwise defined as de novo AML. To test whether a chromatin-spliceosome (CS) mutational signature might better inform the definition of the de novo AML group, we analyzed a prospective cohort of 413 newly diagnosed AML patients enrolled into a randomized clinical trial (NILG AML 02/06) and provided with accurate cytogenetic and molecular characterization. Among clinically defined de novo AML, 17.6% carried CS mutations (CS-AML) and showed clinical characteristics closer to sAML (older age, lower white blood cell counts and higher rate of multilineage dysplasia). Outcomes in this group were adverse, more similar to those of sAML as compared to de novo AML (overall survival, 30% in CS-AML and 17% in sAML vs 61% in de novo AML, P<0.0001; disease free survival, 26% in CS-AML and 22% in sAML vs 54% of de novo AML, P<0.001) and independently confirmed by multivariable analysis. Allogeneic transplant in first complete remission improved survival in both sAML and CS-AML patients.

No signal for serious immune-related AEs such as Guillain-Barré syndrome/polyradiculopathy was observed and there was no evidence of immunogenicity. PK showed rapid clearance with apparent half-life <2 days for conjugated and total antibody, suggesting that Q3W dosing may be insufficient for therapeutic efficacy, and prompting exploration of a QW schedule. Two patients achieved complete responses with incomplete hematologic recovery; one each at 30 and 37.5 μg/kg QW.

Median TDT was 3 days (interquartile range, 2-7). Unadjusted 2-year OS rates, stratified by TDT of 0 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and >15 days, were 51%, 48%, 44%, and 50% (P = .211).

Five hundred and nine patients aged 60 years or older (median age, 68 years) were prospectively enrolled in the intensive Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA)-1200 trial between 2012 and 2016, and 471 patient samples were submitted to multigene analysis. Mutations in any of 8 genes frequently altered in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), including ASXL1, SRSF2, STAG2, BCOR, U2AF1, EZH2, SF3B1, and ZRSR2, defined a secondary AML (sAML)-like disease, as reported. Of the samples analyzed, 48% included sAML-like gene mutations. These mutations were associated with a shorter event-free survival, both overall (hazard ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.79; P < .001) and within the European LeukemiaNet (ELN)-2017 intermediate-risk subgroup (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.28; P = .044), which excludes ASXL1-mutated cases by definition. We therefore included patients with intermediate-risk AML carrying sAML-like mutations in a single high-risk patients group together with adverse-risk patients with AML, whereas other intermediate-risk patients were included in a standard-risk group together with favorable-risk patients (high-risk/standard-risk patient ratio, 1.00). Using this 2-class risk assessment, we observed that transplantation prolonged overall survival from remission in patients with high-risk AML only, not in patients with standard-risk AML. Routine analysis of sAML-like gene mutations may thus improve the definition of high-risk older patients with AML, and better identify the half of older patients who clearly derive survival benefit from allogeneic transplantation in first remission.

A total of 26 patients received 120-300 mg AP of idasanutlin. The MTD was 200 mg, with DLTs at 250 (2/8 patients) and 300 mg (2/5). Treatment-related adverse events in >20% of patients were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and fatigue. Six deaths (23.1%) occurred, all unrelated to treatment. Pharmacokinetics showed rapid and near-complete conversion of the prodrug to AP and dose-proportional exposure across doses. Variability ranged from 30%-47% (22%-54% for idasanutlin). TP53 was 21 (87.5%) wild-type and 3 mutant (12.5%). The composite response rate (complete remission [CR], CR with incomplete hematologic recovery/morphological leukemia-free state [CRi/MLFS], or CR without platelet recovery [CRp]) was 7.7%. Antileukemic activity (CR, CRi/MLFS, partial response, hematologic improvement/stable disease) was observed in 11 patients (disease control rate, 42%): 10/11 were TP53 wild-type; 1 had no sample. p53 activation was demonstrated by MIC-1 induction and was associated with AP exposure. There was not sufficient differentiation or improvement in the biologic or safety profile compared with oral idasanutlin to support continued development of RO6839921.

Its pathogenesis comprises subversion of transcriptional regulation, through mutation and by hijacking normal chromatin regulation. Kat2a is a histone acetyltransferase central to promoter activity, that we recently associated with stability of pluripotency networks, and identified as a genetic vulnerability in AML. Through combined chromatin profiling and single-cell transcriptomics of a conditional knockout mouse, we demonstrate that Kat2a contributes to leukemia propagation through preservation of leukemia stem-like cells. Kat2a loss impacts transcription factor binding and reduces transcriptional burst frequency in a subset of gene promoters, generating enhanced variability of transcript levels. Destabilization of target programs shifts leukemia cell fate out of self-renewal into differentiation. We propose that control of transcriptional variability is central to leukemia stem-like cell propagation, and establish a paradigm exploitable in different tumors and distinct stages of cancer evolution.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Chromatin, Histone Acetyltransferases, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Mice, Knockout, Neoplastic Stem Cells, Single-Cell Analysis, Transcription, Genetic, Transcriptome","ListElement([StringElement('Kat2a', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Single-cell RNA seq', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('acute myeloid leukaemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cancer biology', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('chromosomes', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('epigenetics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('gene expression', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('mouse', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('transcriptional bursting', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('transcriptional heterogeneity', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE118769']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE118769

In a randomized trial comparing standard vs high-dose induction (ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00495287), we studied early peripheral blast cell clearance (PBC) as a rapid predictive assay of chemotherapy response to determine whether it correlates with the achievement of complete remission (CR), as well as postremission outcome, according to induction intensity. Individual leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) identified pretherapy by flow cytometry were validated and quantified centrally after 3 days of treatment, expressing PBC on a logarithmic scale as the ratio of absolute LAIP+ cells on day 1 and day 4. Of 178 patients, 151 (84.8%) were evaluable. Patients in CR exhibited significantly higher median PBC (2.3 log) compared with chemoresistant patients (1.0 log; P < .0001). PBC < 1.0 predicted the worst outcome (CR, 28%). With 1.5 log established as the most accurate cutoff predicting CR, 87.5% of patients with PBC >1.5 (PBChigh, n = 96) and 43.6% of patients with PBC ≤1.5 (PBClow, n = 55) achieved CR after single-course induction (P < .0001). CR and PBChigh rates were increased in patients randomized to the high-dose induction arm (P = .04) and correlated strongly with genetic/cytogenetic risk. In multivariate analysis, PBC retained significant predictive power for CR, relapse risk, and survival.

They received 3 courses of high-dose cytarabine therapy and no further treatment until hematological relapse. Mutations in exons 8, 10-11, and 17 of the KIT gene were analyzed. Furthermore, we analyzed mutations in 56 genes that are frequently identified in myeloid malignancies and evaluated minimal residual disease (MRD). The primary end point was relapse-free survival (RFS) according to KIT mutations. The RFS in KIT-mutated patients was inferior to that in unmutated patients (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-3.00; P = .003). Based on subgroup analysis, KIT mutations had a prognostic impact in patients with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, but not in those with CBFB-MYH11, and only exon 17 mutation had a significant prognostic impact. Multivariate Cox regression analysis with stepwise selection revealed that the KIT exon 17 mutation and the presence of extramedullary tumors in patients with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, and loss of chromosome X or Y and NRAS mutation in patients with CBFB-MYH11 were poor prognostic factors for RFS. MRD was evaluated in 112 patients, and it was associated with a poorer RFS in the patients with CBFB-MYH11, but not in those with RUNX1-RUNX1T1.

Nevertheless, its use in older patients is considerably limited due to increased toxicity. BST-236 (INN aspacytarabine) is a novel cytarabine prodrug designed to deliver high-dose cytarabine to target cells with reduced systemic exposure to free cytarabine. This phase 1/2a dose-escalation study was designed to evaluate BST-236 safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in older or unfit-for-intensive-therapy patients with acute leukemia. Twenty-six patients, unfit for standard therapy, who were either relapsed/refractory or newly diagnosed, received BST-236 in 6 dose-escalating cohorts (range 0.3 to 6 g/m2 per day). BST-236 was administered intravenously once daily over 60 minutes for 6 consecutive days. The median age was 76.5 (26 to 90), with 84.6% of patients ≥70 years. BST-236 was safe and well tolerated. The maximal tolerated dose was 6 g/m2 per day. Overall response rate was 29.6%. A subgroup analysis of newly diagnosed patients with AML, de novo or secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome, unfit for standard induction (median age 78), demonstrated overall response of 45.5%. The median overall survival was 6.5 months and was not reached in patients achieving complete remission. The findings of this phase 1/2 study suggest that BST-236 safely delivers high and efficacious cytarabine doses to older patients who are unfit for standard induction and lays the foundation for further studies of BST-236 in AML.

31640986,The R882H substitution in the human <i>de novo</i> DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A disrupts allosteric regulation by the tumor supressor p53.,"Sandoval Jonathan E, Reich Norbert O",The Journal of biological chemistry,"{'Year': '2019', 'Month': 'Nov', 'Day': '29'}","A myriad of protein partners modulate the activity of the human DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), whose interactions with these other proteins are frequently altered during oncogenesis. We show here that the tumor suppressor p53 decreases DNMT3A activity by forming a heterotetramer complex with DNMT3A. Mutational and modeling experiments suggested that p53 interacts with the same region in DNMT3A as does the structurally characterized DNMT3L. We observed that the p53-mediated repression of DNMT3A activity is blocked by amino acid substitutions within this interface, but surprisingly, also by a distal DNMT3A residue, R882H. DNMT3A R882H occurs frequently in various cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, and our results suggest that the effects of R882H and other <i>DNMT3A</i> mutations may go beyond changes in DNMT3A methylation activity. To further understand the dynamics of how protein-protein interactions modulate DNMT3A activity, we determined that p53 has a greater affinity for DNMT3A than for DNMT3L and that p53 readily displaces DNMT3L from the DNMT3A:DNMT3L heterotetramer.

Fifteen patients, median age 62 (range 37-76) years, were treated: ten with advanced acute myeloid leukemia, five with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. All patients had evidence of disease prior to treatment including nine with marrow blast counts ranging from 7-84% and six with minimal residual disease.

Surprisingly, disrupting the ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor DCAF15 strongly sensitized cancer cells to NK-mediated clearance. DCAF15 disruption induced an inflamed state in leukemic cells, including increased expression of lymphocyte costimulatory molecules. Proteomic and biochemical analysis revealed that cohesin complex members were endogenous client substrates of DCAF15. Genetic disruption of DCAF15 was phenocopied by treatment with indisulam, an anticancer drug that functions through DCAF15 engagement.

Achieving greater success with therapeutic antibodies requires careful characterization of the potential target molecules on AML. One potential target is CD300f, which is an immunoregulatory molecule expressed predominantly on myeloid lineage cells. To confirm the value of CD300f as a leukemic target, we showed that CD300f antibodies bind to AML from 85% of patient samples. While one CD300f monoclonal antibody (mAb) reportedly did not bind healthy hematopoietic stem cells, transcriptomic analysis found that CD300f transcripts are expressed by healthy HSPC. Several CD300f protein isoforms exist as a result of alternative splicing. Importantly for antibody targeting, the extracellular region of CD300f can be present with or without the exon 4-encoded sequence. This results in CD300f isoforms that are differentially bound by CD300f-specific antibodies. Furthermore, binding of one mAb, DCR-2, to CD300f exposes a structural epitope recognized by a second CD300f mAb, UP-D2. Detailed analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data indicated that CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPC expressed fewer CD300f transcripts that lacked exon 4 compared to AML with monocytic differentiation. Analysis of a small cohort of AML cells revealed that the UP-D2 conformational binding site could be induced in cells from AML patients with monocytic differentiation but not those from other AML or HSPC. This provides the opportunity to develop an antibody-based strategy to target AMLs with monocytic differentiation but not healthy CD34<sup>+</sup> HSPCs. This would be a major step forward in developing effective anti-AML therapeutic antibodies with reduced hematologic toxicity.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Antibodies, Monoclonal, Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological, Cell Line, Tumor, Epitopes, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Molecular Targeted Therapy, Monocytes, Receptors, Immunologic","ListElement([StringElement('CD300f', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('acute myeloid leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('antibody epitopes', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cell surface targeting', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('isoform expression', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('monoclonal antibodies', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NP_620587', 'NP_001276011', 'NP_001276012', 'NP_001276013', 'NP_001276014', 'NP_001276015', 'NP_001276016']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,NP_620587

Forty-two patients received either intravenous (IV) (NCT01385423) or subcutaneous (SC) (NCT02395822) recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15) after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and haploidentical NK cells.

We aimed to examine the robustness of EFS, specifically timing of complete remission (CR) in defining induction failure and impact of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The study included 1884 untreated AML patients enrolled across 5 trials conducted through Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology using anthracycline and cytarabine induction chemotherapy. EFS was defined as time from randomization/registration to induction failure, relapse, or death. Three definitions of induction failure were evaluated: failure to achieve CR by 60 days after randomization/registration, failure to achieve CR by the end of all protocol-defined induction courses, and failure to achieve CR by the end of all protocol-defined treatment. We considered either censoring or no censoring at time of non-protocol-mandated HCT. Although relapse and death are firm end points, the determination of induction failure was not consistent across studies. There was minimal impact of censoring at HCT on EFS estimates; however, median EFS estimates differed considerably based on the timing of CR in defining induction failure, with the magnitude of difference being large enough in most cases to lead to incorrect conclusions about efficacy in a single-arm trial, if the trial definition was not consistent with the definition used for the historical control. Timing of CR should be carefully examined in the historical control data used to guide the design of single-arm trials using EFS as the primary end point.

Patients received cyclophosphamide (Day - 7), fludarabine (Days - 6 through - 2), and subcutaneous interleukin-2 (Days - 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9). Purified, unmanipulated NK cells were infused on Day 0, and NK cell chimerism and phenotyping from peripheral blood were performed on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28.

The negative effects of dysregulated DNA methylation are highlighted by a strong correlation between mutations in the <i>de novo</i> DNA methyltransferase gene <i>DNA methyltransferase 3</i>α (<i>DNMT3A</i>) and poor prognoses among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. We show here that clinically observed <i>DNMT3A</i> mutations dramatically alter enzymatic activity, including mutations that lead to 6-fold hypermethylation and 3-fold hypomethylation of the human <i>cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B</i> (<i>CDKN2B</i> or <i>p15</i>) gene promoter. Our results provide insights into the clinically observed heterogeneity of <i>p15</i> methylation in AML. Cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) constitutes 40-50% of all AML cases and is the most epigenetically diverse AML subtype with pronounced changes in non-CpG DNA methylation. We identified a subset of DNMT3A mutations that enhance the enzyme's ability to perform non-CpG methylation by 2-8-fold. Many of these mutations mapped to DNMT3A regions known to interact with proteins that themselves contribute to AML, such as thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG). Using functional mapping of TDG-DNMT3A interactions, we provide evidence that TDG and DNMT3-like (DNMT3L) bind distinct regions of DNMT3A. Furthermore, DNMT3A mutations caused diverse changes in the ability of TDG and DNMT3L to affect DNMT3A function. Cell-based studies of one of these DNMT3A mutations (S714C) replicated the enzymatic studies and revealed that it causes dramatic losses of genome-wide methylation. In summary, mutations in DNMT3A lead to diverse levels of activity, interactions with epigenetic machinery components and cellular changes.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","Animals, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15, DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases, DNA Methylation, DNA Methyltransferase 3A, Epigenesis, Genetic, Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Mutation, Thymine DNA Glycosylase","ListElement([StringElement('DNA binding protein', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('DNA methylation', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('DNA methyltransferase', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('enzyme catalysis', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('enzyme kinetics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('enzyme mutation', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('epigenetics', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'PDB', 'AccessionNumberList': ['2QRV', '3EEO']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013486'})]",PDB,2QRV

The purpose of this single-center Phase I study was to determine the safety and tolerability of administration of the CXCR4 inhibitor plerixafor (Mozobil; Sanofi Genzyme) along with myeloablative conditioning in patients with AML undergoing allogeneic HCT. The rationale was that plerixafor may mobilize leukemic stem cells, making them more susceptible to the conditioning chemotherapy (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier NCT01141543). Three patients were enrolled into each of 4 sequential cohorts (12 patients total). Patients in the first cohort received 1 dose of plerixafor (240 μg/kg s.c.) before the first dose of fludarabine and busulfan, and subsequent cohorts received injections before 2, 3, and 4 days of conditioning chemotherapy. The median age at HCT was 49 years (range, 38 to 58 years). All patients engrafted following HCT, with an absolute neutrophil count ≥.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L observed at a median of 14 days (range, 11 to 18 days). Adverse events possibly related to plerixafor were transient and not severe. Main adverse events following the injection were nausea and dizziness in 4 patients (33%) and fatigue in 4 patients (33%). Among the 12 patients, 2 patients (17%) relapsed post-HCT and 6 (50%) were alive at the last follow-up. The median follow-up of survivors was 67 months (range, 53 to 82 months). In conclusion, plerixafor administration is safe and well tolerated when included in a myeloablative conditioning regimen for allogeneic HCT for AML. Further study in a larger cohort is warranted for the investigation of the impact of plerixafor on post-allogeneic HCT outcomes.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult, Anti-HIV Agents, Benzylamines, Cyclams, Female, Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization, Heterocyclic Compounds, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Middle Aged, Transplantation, Homologous","ListElement([StringElement('Acute myelogenous leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Allogeneic transplantation', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Myeloablative', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Phase I', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Plerixafor', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT01141543']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT01141543

In the second trial patients were randomized to standard-dose cytarabine or high-dose cytarabine induction, both with daunorubicin and etoposide. In both trials, patients who achieved a complete remission with or without complete hematologic recovery underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation if they had a donor; otherwise, they underwent autologous transplantation. In comparison to patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics without a monosomal karyotype (n=1,584) and with adverse cytogenetics without a monosomal karyotype (n=218), patients with a monosomal karyotype (n=188) were more likely not to achieve a complete remission with or without count recovery [odds ratio=2.85, 95% confidence interval (95%, CI): 2.10-3.88] and had shorter overall survival [hazard ratio, (HR)=2.44, 95% CI: 2.08-2.88]. There was no impact of the type of anthracycline or of the dose of cytarabine on outcomes in patients with a monosomal karyotype. Among monosomal karyo type patients who achieved a complete remission with or without count recovery, HLA-identical related donor availability was associated with longer survival from complete remission with or without count recovery (HR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.37-0.95).

Enasidenib is an oral inhibitor of mutant-IDH2 proteins. This first-in-human phase 1/2 study evaluated enasidenib doses of 50 to 650 mg/d, administered in continuous 28-day cycles, in patients with mutant-<i>IDH2</i> hematologic malignancies. Overall, 214 of 345 patients (62%) with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML received enasidenib, 100 mg/d. Median age was 68 years. Forty-two patients (19.6%) attained complete remission (CR), 19 patients (10.3%) proceeded to an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and the overall response rate was 38.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 32.2-45.7). Median overall survival was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.7-9.6). Response and survival were comparable among patients with <i>IDH2</i>-R140 or <i>IDH2</i>-R172 mutations. Response rates were similar among patients who, at study entry, were in relapse (37.7%) or were refractory to intensive (37.5%) or nonintensive (43.2%) therapies. Sixty-six (43.1%) red blood cell transfusion-dependent and 53 (40.2%) platelet transfusion-dependent patients achieved transfusion independence. The magnitude of 2-HG reduction on study was associated with CR in <i>IDH2</i>-R172 patients. Clearance of mutant-<i>IDH2</i> clones was also associated with achievement of CR. Among all 345 patients, the most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were hyperbilirubinemia (10%), thrombocytopenia (7%), and IDH differentiation syndrome (6%).

In addition to being substrates, cellular nucleotides also allosterically regulate SAMHD1 activity. Recently, it was shown that high expression levels of SAMHD1 are also correlated with significantly worse patient responses to nucleotide analog drugs important for treating a variety of cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we used biochemical, structural, and cellular methods to examine the interactions of various cancer drugs with SAMHD1. We found that both the catalytic and the allosteric sites of SAMHD1 are sensitive to sugar modifications of the nucleotide analogs, with the allosteric site being significantly more restrictive. We crystallized cladribine-TP, clofarabine-TP, fludarabine-TP, vidarabine-TP, cytarabine-TP, and gemcitabine-TP in the catalytic pocket of SAMHD1. We found that all of these drugs are substrates of SAMHD1 and that the efficacy of most of these drugs is affected by SAMHD1 activity. Of the nucleotide analogs tested, only cladribine-TP with a deoxyribose sugar efficiently induced the catalytically active SAMHD1 tetramer. Together, these results establish a detailed framework for understanding the substrate specificity and allosteric activation of SAMHD1 with regard to nucleotide analogs, which can be used to improve current cancer and antiviral therapies.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","Allosteric Site, Antineoplastic Agents, Catalytic Domain, Cell Line, Tumor, Crystallography, X-Ray, Drug Interactions, HL-60 Cells, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Nucleotides, SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1, Substrate Specificity","ListElement([StringElement('SAMHD1', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('allosteric regulation', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('dNTPase', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('nucleotide analog drugs', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('substrate selection', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'PDB', 'AccessionNumberList': ['6DW4', '6DWD', '6DWK', '6DW3', '6DW5', '6DW7']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013486'})]",PDB,6DW4

We investigated the effects of two n-3 PUFAs, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts. EPA and DHA induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in five AML cell lines, which was also observed with FO, but not SO (devoid of n-3 PUFAs) in cell lines and primary leucoblasts. Mitochondrial energy metabolism shifted from oxidative respiration to glycolytic metabolism in the U937, MOLM-13, and HL-60 cell lines. This phenomenon was associated with major disorganization of the mitochondrial network and mitochondrial swelling. Transcriptomic analysis after 6 h and 24 h of exposure to FO revealed a Nrf2 activation signature, which was confirmed by evidence of Nrf2 nuclear translocation in response to oxidative stress, but insufficient to prevent cell death following prolonged exposure. Apoptosis studies showed consistent phosphatidylserine exposition among the AML cell lines tested and a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. The cell-killing effect of FO was additive with that of cytarabine (AraC), by the Chou and Talalay method, and this combination effect could be reproduced in primary AML blasts.

Oral TDZ was administered at 3 dose levels: 25 mg (n = 6), 50 mg (n = 4), or 100 mg (n = 3) every 6 hours for 21 days. Intermediate-dose cytarabine was administered on days 6 to 10. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) included grade 3 QTc interval prolongation in 1 patient at 25 mg TDZ and neurological events in 2 patients at 100 mg TDZ (gait disturbance, depressed consciousness, and dizziness). At the 50-mg TDZ dose, the sum of circulating DRD2 antagonist levels approached a concentration of 10 μM, a level noted to be selectively active against human AML in vitro. Eleven of 13 patients completed a 5-day lead-in with TDZ, of which 6 received TDZ with hydroxyurea and 5 received TDZ alone. During this period, 8 patients demonstrated a 19% to 55% reduction in blast levels, whereas 3 patients displayed progressive disease. The extent of blast reduction during this 5-day interval was associated with the expression of the putative TDZ target receptor DRD2 on leukemic cells. These preliminary results suggest that DRD2 represents a potential therapeutic target for AML disease. Future studies are required to corroborate these observations, including the use of modified DRD2 antagonists with improved tolerability in AML patients.

In this randomized trial, we compared arsenic, all-<i>trans</i> retinoic acid and the ""classical"" cytarabine for consolidation treatment (after all-<i>trans</i> retinoic acid and chemotherapy induction treatment) in standard-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia, and evaluated the addition of arsenic during consolidation in higher-risk disease.

Prior clinical studies demonstrated a sustained drug ratio and exposure in vivo and prolonged survival versus standard-of-care cytarabine plus daunorubicin chemotherapy (7+3 regimen) in older patients with newly diagnosed secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML). Patients and Methods In this open-label, randomized, phase III trial, 309 patients age 60 to 75 years with newly diagnosed high-risk/sAML received one to two induction cycles of CPX-351 or 7+3 followed by consolidation therapy with a similar regimen. The primary end point was overall survival. Results CPX-351 significantly improved median overall survival versus 7+3 (9.56 v 5.95 months; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.90; one-sided P = .003). Overall remission rate was also significantly higher with CPX-351 versus 7+3 (47.7% v 33.3%; two-sided P = .016). Improved outcomes were observed across age-groups and AML subtypes. The incidences of nonhematologic adverse events were comparable between arms, despite a longer treatment phase and prolonged time to neutrophil and platelet count recovery with CPX-351.

Patients with defined subclones had an OS similar to those with no subclones (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88-1.26), but CP patients had a shorter OS (HR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.11-2.26).

The prognosis of older acute myeloid leukemia patients is generally poor. While genetic markers have become important tools for risk stratification and treatment selection in young and middle-aged patients, their applicability in very old patients is less clear. We sought to validate existing genetic risk classification systems and identify additional factors associated with outcomes in intensively treated patients aged ≥75 years. In 151 patients who received induction chemotherapy in the AMLCG-1999 trial, we investigated recurrently mutated genes using a targeted sequencing assay covering 64 genes. The median number of mutated genes per patient was four. The most commonly mutated genes were <i>TET2</i> (42%), <i>DNMT3A</i> (35%), <i>NPM1</i> (32%), <i>SRSF2</i> (25%) and <i>ASXL1</i> (21%). The complete remission rate was 44% and the 3-year survival was 21% for the entire cohort. While adverse-risk cytogenetics (MRC classification) were associated with shorter overall survival (<i>P</i>=0.001), <i>NPM1</i> and <i>FLT3</i>-ITD mutations (present in 18%) did not have a significant impact on overall survival. Notably, none of the 13 <i>IDH1</i>-mutated patients (9%) reached complete remission. Consequently, the overall survival of this subgroup was significantly shorter than that of <i>IDH1</i>-wildtype patients (<i>P</i><0.001). In summary, even among very old, intensively treated, acute myeloid leukemia patients, adverse-risk cytogenetics predict inferior survival. The spectrum and relevance of driver gene mutations in elderly patients differs from that in younger patients.

Activation of these additional kinases may also result in phosphorylation of tumor suppressor proteins promoting their nuclear export. Thus, co-targeting nuclear export proteins (e.g., XPO1) and FLT3 concomitantly may be therapeutically effective. Here we report on the combinatorial inhibition of XPO1 using selinexor and FLT3 using sorafenib. Selinexor exerted marked cell killing of human and murine <i>FLT3</i>-mutant acute myeloid leukemia cells, including those harboring internal tandem duplication and/or tyrosine kinase domain point mutations. Interestingly, selinexor treatment of murine <i>FLT3</i>-mutant acute myeloid leukemia cells activated FLT3 and its downstream MAPK or AKT signaling pathways. When combined with sorafenib, selinexor triggered marked synergistic pro-apoptotic effects. This was preceded by elevated nuclear levels of ERK, AKT, NFκB, and FOXO3a. Five days of <i>in vitro</i> combination treatment using low doses (i.e., 5 to 10 nM) of each agent promoted early myeloid differentiation of MOLM13 and MOLM14 cells without noticeable cell killing.

Patients and Methods One hundred thirty-one previously untreated patients with AML who received intensive induction chemotherapy and attained morphologic complete remission (CR) at day 30 were studied. Pretreatment and CR bone marrow were analyzed using targeted capture DNA sequencing. We analyzed the association between mutation clearance (MC) on the basis of variant allele frequency (VAF) at CR (MC2.5: if the VAF of residual mutations was < 2.5%; MC1.0: if the VAF was < 1%; and complete MC [CMC]: if no detectable residual mutations) and event-free survival, overall survival (OS), and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). Results MC1.0 and CMC were associated with significantly better OS (2-year OS: 75% v 61% in MC1.0 v non-MC1.0; P = .0465; 2-year OS: 77% v 60% in CMC v non-CMC; P = .0303) and lower CIR (2-year CIR: 26% v 46% in MC1.0 v non-MC 1.0; P = .0349; 2 year-CIR: 24% v 46% in CMC v non-CMC; P = .03), whereas there was no significant difference in any of the above outcomes by MC2.5. Multivariable analysis adjusting for age, cytogenetic risk, allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, and flow cytometry-based minimal residual disease revealed that patients with CMC had significantly better event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; P = .0083), OS (HR, 0.47; P = .04), and CIR (HR, 0.27; P < .001) than did patients without CMC. These prognostic associations were stronger when preleukemic mutations, such as DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1, were removed from the analysis. Conclusion Clearance of somatic mutation at CR, particularly in nonpreleukemic genes, was associated with significantly better survival and less risk of relapse. Somatic mutations in nonpreleukemic genes may function as a molecular minimal residual disease marker in AML.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic, Clofarabine, Cohort Studies, Cytarabine, DNA, Neoplasm, Female, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Humans, Idarubicin, Induction Chemotherapy, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Middle Aged, Mutation, Recurrence, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Vidarabine",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT01025154', 'NCT01289457', 'NCT02115295']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT01025154

Although this system is highly expressed in interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated cells and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1)-expressing cells, its identity remains incompletely understood. Tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) is also highly expressed in IFN-γ-treated cells and also has high affinity and selectivity for Trp. Here, we investigated the effects of human TrpRS expression on Trp uptake into IFN-γ-treated human THP-1 monocytes or HeLa cells. Inhibition of human TrpRS expression by TrpRS-specific siRNAs decreased and overexpression of TrpRS increased Trp uptake into the cells. Of note, the TrpRS-mediated uptake system had more than hundred-fold higher affinity for Trp than the known System L amino acid transporter, promoted uptake of low Trp concentrations, and had very high Trp selectivity. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicated that Trp- and ATP-binding sites, but not tRNA-binding sites, in TrpRS are essential for TrpRS-mediated Trp uptake into the human cells. We further demonstrate that the addition of purified TrpRS to cell culture medium increases Trp uptake into cells. Taken together, our results reveal that TrpRS plays an important role in high-affinity Trp uptake into human cells.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Binding Sites, Crystallography, X-Ray, HeLa Cells, Humans, Interferon-gamma, Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute, Protein Binding, Protein Conformation, Tryptophan, Tryptophan-tRNA Ligase, Tumor Cells, Cultured","ListElement([StringElement('amino acid transport', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('aminoacyl tRNA synthetase', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1)', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('interferon', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('mutagenesis', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('tryptophan', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'PDB', 'AccessionNumberList': ['1R6T']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",PDB,1R6T

We treated 130 patients, aged <65, with a median age of 52 years. FLAI-GO induction regimen included fludarabine (30 mg/sqm) and cytarabine (2 g/sqm) on days 1-5; idarubicin (10 mg/sqm) on days 1, 3, and 5; and GO (3 mg/sqm) on day 6. SCT was planned for all high-risk AML patients, after consolidation with intermediate doses of cytarabine and idarubicin and a high dose of cytarabine. CD33 expression exceeded 20% in all cases. Primary endpoints of the study included feasibility, overall response rate (ORR) and toxicity. Secondary endpoints included the evaluation of MRD by WT1 expression, feasibility and outcome of consolidation with SCT, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). After induction with FLAI-GO, complete remission (CR) rate was 82%. Four patients achieved partial remission (PR) and 12% were resistant (ORR 85%); death during induction (DDI) was 3%. The hematological and extra hematological toxicity of FLAI-GO was manageable; 45% of patients experienced transient and reversible GO infusion related adverse events. In the setting of patients who achieved a cytological CR after FLAI-GO, the mean of WT1 copies dropped from 8337±9936 copies/10<sup>4</sup> ABL (diagnosis) to 182 ± 436 copies after induction therapy (p = 0.0001) showing a very good disease debulking. After a median follow-up of 54 months, 67/130 (52%) patients were alive. The probability of 1, 2, and 5-year OS was 80%, 63%, and 52%, respectively. The probability of 1, 2, and 5-year DFS was 77%, 58%, and 52%, respectively. Allogeneic and autologous SCT was performed in 60 (46%) and 23 (18%) patients, respectively. In summary, the final results of this trial confirm that FLAI-GO is an active and safe treatment strategy for CD33-positive AML patients aged ≤ 65 years, allowing a high ORR, a good disease debulking, favorable safety profile, low DDI, and subsequent high SCT rate. The encouraging results of this trial, consolidated by a long follow-up, support the reintroduction of GO in clinical practice.","Clinical Trial, Phase II, Journal Article, Multicenter Study","Adolescent, Adult, Aminoglycosides, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized, Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols, Cytarabine, Gemtuzumab, Humans, Idarubicin, Induction Chemotherapy, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Middle Aged, Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3, Treatment Outcome, Vidarabine, Young Adult",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT00909168']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase II', attributes={'UI': 'D017427'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Multicenter Study', attributes={'UI': 'D016448'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT00909168

In addition, it also exerts tumor-suppressive functions in p53-independent contexts. The activities of p14arf are regulated by the nucleolar chaperone nucleophosmin (NPM1), which controls its levels and cellular localization. In acute myeloid leukemia with mutations in the NPM1 gene, mutated NPM1 aberrantly translocates in the cytosol carrying with itself p14arf that is subsequently degraded, thus impairing the p14arf-HDM2-p53 axis. In this work we investigated the complex between these two proteins by means of NMR and other techniques. We identified a novel NPM1-interacting motif in the C-terminal region of p14arf, which corresponds to its predicted nucleolar localization signal. This motif recognizes a specific region of the NPM1 N-terminal domain and, upon binding, the two proteins form soluble high molecular weight complexes. By NMR, we identified critical residues on both proteins involved in the interaction. Collectively, our data provide a structural framework to rationalize the overall assembly of the p14arf-NPM1 supramolecular complexes.

In order to reduce the relapse risk and improve the survival, the strategy of early tapering of immunosuppressive agents was prospectively evaluated. Thirty-one patients with advanced AML received early tapering of immunosuppressive drugs, while 32 patients with AML in complete remission (CR) were given the routine tapering of immunosuppressive agents after HLA-matched donor transplantation. All advanced AML patients achieved CR after allo-HSCT. At 24 months after transplantation, relapse incidences were 22% in advanced group and 16% in CR group (P = 0.553); disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were 57.7 and 57.8% in advanced group, while in CR group were 66.6% (P = 0.388) and 66.2% (P = 0.423); immunosuppressive agent-free DFS (IDFS) were similar between two groups (P = 0.407). Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) incidences were similar between two groups (P = 0.311).

New sequential approaches employing T-cell depleted transplantation directly after chemotherapy show promise but are burdened by viral infection and require donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) to augment donor chimerism and graft-versus-leukaemia effects. T-replete transplantation in sequential approaches could reduce both viral infection and DLI usage. We therefore performed a single-arm prospective Phase II clinical trial of sequential chemotherapy and T-replete transplantation using reduced-intensity conditioning without planned DLI. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Forty-seven patients with relapsed/refractory AML or high-risk myelodysplasia were enrolled; 43 proceeded to transplantation. High levels of donor chimerism were achieved spontaneously with no DLI. Overall survival of transplanted patients was 45% and 33% at 1 and 3 years. Only one patient developed cytomegalovirus disease. Cumulative incidences of treatment-related mortality and relapse were 35% and 20% at 1 year. Patients with relapsed AML and myelodysplasia had the most favourable outcomes.

We sought to develop a complementary pharmacological approach whereby proteasome-mediated FLT3 degradation could be promoted by inhibitors of the deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) responsible for cleaving ubiquitin from FLT3.

We conducted a first-in-human trial of TCR-gene transduced T-cell (TCR-T-cell) transfer in patients with refractory acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and high-risk MDS to investigate the safety and cell kinetics of the T cells. The WT1-specific TCR-gene was transduced to T cells using a retroviral vector encoding small interfering RNAs for endogenous TCR genes. The T cells were transferred twice with a 4-week interval in a dose-escalating design. After the second transfer, sequential WT1 peptide vaccines were given. Eight patients, divided into 2 dose cohorts, received cell transfer. No adverse events of normal tissue were seen. The TCR-T cells were detected in peripheral blood for 8 weeks at levels proportional to the dose administered, and in 5 patients, they persisted throughout the study period. The persisting cells maintained ex vivo peptide-specific immune reactivity. Two patients showed transient decreases in blast counts in bone marrow, which was associated with recovery of hematopoiesis. Four of 5 patients who had persistent T cells at the end of the study survived more than 12 months.

Enasidenib (AG-221/CC-90007) is a first-in-class, oral, selective inhibitor of mutant-IDH2 enzymes. This first-in-human phase 1/2 study assessed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, safety, and clinical activity of enasidenib in patients with mutant-<i>IDH2</i> advanced myeloid malignancies. We assessed safety outcomes for all patients and clinical efficacy in the largest patient subgroup, those with relapsed or refractory AML, from the phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion phases of the study. In the dose-escalation phase, an MTD was not reached at doses ranging from 50 to 650 mg per day. Enasidenib 100 mg once daily was selected for the expansion phase on the basis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and demonstrated efficacy. Grade 3 to 4 enasidenib-related adverse events included indirect hyperbilirubinemia (12%) and IDH-inhibitor-associated differentiation syndrome (7%). Among patients with relapsed or refractory AML, overall response rate was 40.3%, with a median response duration of 5.8 months. Responses were associated with cellular differentiation and maturation, typically without evidence of aplasia. Median overall survival among relapsed/refractory patients was 9.3 months, and for the 34 patients (19.3%) who attained complete remission, overall survival was 19.7 months. Continuous daily enasidenib treatment was generally well tolerated and induced hematologic responses in patients for whom prior AML therapy had failed.

Human KIR haplotypes comprise genes encoding mainly inhibitory receptors (KIR A) or activating and inhibitory receptors (KIR B). A substantial fraction of humans lack ligands for inhibitory KIRs (iKIRs), that is, a 'missing ligand' genotype. KIR B/x and missing ligand genotypes may thus give rise to potentially autoreactive, unlicensed NK cells. Little is known regarding the impact of such genotypes in untransplanted acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For this study, NK cell phenotypes and KIR/HLA genotypes were determined in 81 AML patients who received immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride and low-dose IL-2 for relapse prevention (NCT01347996). We observed that presence of unlicensed NK cells impacted favorably on clinical outcome, in particular among patients harboring functional NK cells reflected by high expression of the natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) NKp46. Genotype analyses suggested that the clinical benefit of high NCR expression was restricted to patients with a missing ligand genotype and/or a KIR B/x genotype.

The Children's Oncology Group (COG) AAML0431 trial consisted of 4 cycles of induction and 2 cycles of intensification therapy based on the treatment schema of the previous COG A2971 trial with several modifications. High-dose araC (HD-araC) was used in the second induction cycle instead of the intensification cycle, and 1 of 4 daunorubicin-containing induction cycles was eliminated. For 204 eligible patients, 5-year EFS was 89.9% and overall survival (OS) was 93.0%. The 5-year OS for 17 patients with refractory/relapsed leukemia was 34.3%. We determined the clinical significance of minimal residual disease (MRD) levels as measured by flow cytometry on day 28 of induction I. MRD measurements, available for 146 of the 204 patients, were highly predictive of treatment outcome; 5-year disease-free survival for MRD-negative patients (n = 125) was 92.7% vs 76.2% for MRD-positive patients (n = 21) (log-rank <i>P</i> = .011). Our results indicated that earlier use of HD-araC led to better EFS and OS in AAML0431 than in past COG studies. A 25% reduction in the cumulative daunorubicin dose did not impact outcome. MRD, identified as a new prognostic factor for ML-DS patients, can be used for risk stratification in future clinical trials.

A phase 1 dose-escalation study was initiated to examine the safety and efficacy of selinexor in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. Ninety-five patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were enrolled between January 2013 and June 2014 to receive 4, 8, or 10 doses of selinexor in a 21- or 28-day cycle. The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) in patients with AML were grade 1 or 2 constitutional and gastrointestinal toxicities, which were generally manageable with supportive care. The only nonhematological grade 3/4 AE, occurring in >5% of the patient population, was fatigue (14%). There were no reported dose-limiting toxicities or evidence of cumulative toxicity. The recommended phase 2 dose was established at 60 mg (∼35 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) given twice weekly in a 4-week cycle based on the totality of safety and efficacy data. Overall, 14% of the 81 evaluable patients achieved an objective response (OR) and 31% percent showed ≥50% decrease in bone marrow blasts from baseline. Patients achieving an OR had a significant improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) (5.1 vs 1.3 months; <i>P</i> = .008; hazard ratio [HR], 3.1) and overall survival (9.7 vs 2.7 months; <i>P</i> = .01; HR, 3.1) compared with nonresponders.

In an international phase IV trial (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT01347996), 84 patients with AML in first complete remission who had not undergone transplantation received immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride (HDC) and low-dose IL-2 with the aim of preventing relapse. The dynamics of myeloid cell counts and expression of activation markers was assessed before and after cycles of immunotherapy and correlated with clinical outcome in terms of relapse risk and survival. During cycles, a pronounced increase in blood eosinophil counts was observed along with a reduction in monocyte and neutrophil counts. A strong reduction of blood monocyte counts during the first HDC/IL-2 treatment cycle predicted leukemia-free survival. The HDC component of the immunotherapy exerts agonist activity at histamine type 2 receptors (H2Rs) that are expressed by myeloid cells. It was observed that the density of H<sub>2</sub> R expression in blood monocytes increased during cycles of immunotherapy and that high monocyte H<sub>2</sub>R expression implied reduced relapse risk and improved overall survival. Several other activation markers, including HLA-DR, CD86, and CD40, were induced in monocytes and dendritic cells during immunotherapy but did not predict clinical outcome. In addition, expression of HLA-ABC increased in all myeloid populations during therapy. A low expression of HLA-ABC was associated with reduced relapse risk.

Androgens, used in the treatment of aplastic anemia, have been reported to block proliferation of and initiate differentiation in AML cells. We report the results of a multicenter, phase III, randomized open-label trial exploring the benefit of adding androgens to maintenance therapy in patients 60 years of age or older. Patients and Methods A total of 330 patients with AML de novo or secondary to chemotherapy or radiotherapy were enrolled in the study. Induction therapy included idarubicin 8 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 to 5, cytarabine 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 to 7, and lomustine 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1. Patients in complete remission or partial remission received six reinduction courses, alternating idarubicin 8 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1, cytarabine 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on days 1 to 5, and a regimen of methotrexate and mercaptopurine. Patients were randomly assigned to receive norethandrolone 10 or 20 mg/day, according to body weight, or no norethandrolone for a 2-year maintenance therapy regimen. The primary end point was disease-free survival by intention to treat. Secondary end points were event-free survival, overall survival, and safety. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00700544. Results Random assignment allotted 165 patients to each arm; arm A received norethandrolone, and arm B did not receive norethandrolone. Complete remission or partial remission was achieved in 247 patients (76%). The Schoenfeld time-dependent model showed that norethandrolone significantly improved survival for patients still in remission at 1 year after induction. In arms A and B, respectively, 5-year disease-free survival was 31.2% and 16.2%, event-free survival was 21.5% and 12.9%, and overall survival was 26.3% and 17.2%. Norethandrolone improved outcomes irrelevant to all prognosis factors. Only patients with baseline leukocytes > 30 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L did not benefit from norethandrolone.

Using an ultrasensitive sequencing approach, we detected extremely rare mutations (equivalent to 1 heterozygous mutant cell in 2000 non-mutant cells) months to years before their expansion at disease relapse. While patients can live with persistent clonal hematopoiesis in a CR or stable disease, ultimately we find evidence that expansion of a rare subclone occurs at relapse or progression.

We evaluated the prognostic significance of cytogenetics at complete remission in 258 adults with de novo acute myeloid leukemia and abnormal pre-treatment karyotypes, treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B front-line studies, with cytogenetic data at onset of morphological complete remission. Thirty-two patients had abnormal karyotypes at time of initial complete remission. Of these, 28 had at least 1 abnormality identified pre-treatment, and 4 acute myeloid leukemia-related abnormalities not detected pre-treatment. Two hundred and twenty-six patients had normal remission karyotypes.

Reverse phase protein array suggested that high expression of the essential autophagy-related protein, Atg7, was associated with shorter remission in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples, indicating a role in chemoresistance. Knockdown of Atg7 in AML cells using short hairpin RNA markedly increased apoptosis and DNA damage following treatment with cytarabine and idarubicin. Interestingly, coculture of AML cells with stromal cells increased autophagy and chemoresistance in the AML cells exposed to chemotherapeutic agents, and this was reversed following Atg7 knockdown. This effect was further enhanced by concomitant knockdown of Atg7 in both AML and stromal cells. These findings strongly suggest that Atg7, and likely microenvironment autophagy in general, plays an important role in AML chemoresistance. Mechanistic studies revealed that Atg7 knockdown induced a proapoptotic phenotype in AML cells, which was manifested by an increased NOXA expression at the transcriptional level.

While TP53 missense mutations can also contribute gain-of-function activities that impact tumour progression, it remains unclear whether the deletion event, which frequently includes many genes, impacts tumorigenesis beyond TP53 loss alone. Here we show that somatic heterozygous deletion of mouse chromosome 11B3, a 4-megabase region syntenic to human 17p13.1, produces a greater effect on lymphoma and leukaemia development than Trp53 deletion. Mechanistically, the effect of 11B3 loss on tumorigenesis involves co-deleted genes such as Eif5a and Alox15b (also known as Alox8), the suppression of which cooperates with Trp53 loss to produce more aggressive disease. Our results imply that the selective advantage produced by human chromosome 17p deletion reflects the combined impact of TP53 loss and the reduced dosage of linked tumour suppressor genes.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Alleles, Animals, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17, Chromosomes, Mammalian, Disease Models, Animal, Disease Progression, Female, Genes, p53, Heterozygote, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Lymphoma, Male, Mice, Neoplasms, Peptide Initiation Factors, RNA-Binding Proteins, Sequence Deletion, Synteny, Tumor Suppressor Protein p53, Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 5A",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE69654']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE69654

The advent of UCB transplantation (UCBT) using two grafts successfully circumvents this obstacle, despite the engraftment of only one unit. Preclinical models suggested that the addition of UCB T cells at the time of transplant can enhance engraftment. We tested whether ex vivo activation by CD3/CD28 costimulation and expansion of T cells from a single UCB graft would be safe and feasible in adults with advanced hematologic malignancies, with an overall objective of optimizing engraftment in single unit UCBT. In this phase 1 study, recipients of single UCB units were eligible if the unit was stored in two adequate fractions. Dose limiting toxicity was defined as grade 3 or grade 4 GVHD within 90 days of UCBT. Four patients underwent UCBT; all were treated at the first dose level (10(5) cells/kg). At the 10(5) cells/kg dose level two subjects experienced grade 3 intestinal GVHD, thus meeting stopping criteria. For three subjects, neutrophil engraftment was early (12, 17, and 20 days), while one subject experienced primary graft failure. We observed early donor T cell trafficking and found that expanded T cells produced supraphysiologic levels of cytokines relevant to engraftment and to lymphoid differentiation and function. Taken together, these preliminary data suggest rapid engraftment in recipients of a single UCBT combined with relatively low doses of activated T cells, though potentially complicated by severe GVHD.","Clinical Trial, Phase I, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult, Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts, B-Cell Activating Factor, Blood Preservation, CD28 Antigens, CD3 Complex, Cells, Cultured, Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation, Cryopreservation, Cytokines, Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic, Feasibility Studies, Female, Graft Survival, Graft vs Host Disease, Histocompatibility, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Lymphocyte Transfusion, Male, Maximum Tolerated Dose, Membrane Proteins, Middle Aged, Neutrophils, T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity, T-Lymphocyte Subsets, Transplantation Conditioning, Treatment Outcome",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT00891592']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Clinical Trial, Phase I', attributes={'UI': 'D017426'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT00891592

The leukemic clone's most primitive hematopoietic cellular phenotype was prospectively identified in 109 newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients, and analyzed against clinical risk groups and outcomes. Most (80/109) patients harbored CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia cells. The CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia cells in 47 of the 80 patients displayed intermediate aldehyde dehydrogenase expression, while normal CD34(+)CD38(-) hematopoietic stem cells expressed high levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase. In the other 33/80 patients, the CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia cells exhibited high aldehyde dehydrogenase activity, and most (28/33, 85%) harbored poor-risk cytogenetics or FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem translocations.

However, the precise mechanisms governing the replacement of normal hematopoietic stem cells in their niche by myeloid neoplasm stem cells have not yet been clarified. Primary acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome cells induced aberrant expression of multiple hematopoietic factors including Jagged-1, stem cell factor and angiopoietin-1 in mesenchymal stem cells even in non-contact conditions, and this abnormality was reverted by extracellular vesicle inhibition. Importantly, the transfer of myeloid neoplasm-derived extracellular vesicles reduced the hematopoietic supportive capacity of mesenchymal stem cells. Analysis of extracellular vesicle microRNA indicated that several species, including miR-7977 from acute myeloid leukemia cells, were higher than those from normal CD34(+)cells. Remarkably, the copy number of miR-7977 in bone marrow interstitial fluid was elevated not only in acute myeloid leukemia, but also in myelodysplastic syndrome, as compared with lymphoma without bone marrow localization. The transfection of the miR-7977 mimic reduced the expression of the posttranscriptional regulator, poly(rC) binding protein 1, in mesenchymal stem cells. Moreover, the miR-7977 mimic induced aberrant reduction of hematopoietic growth factors in mesenchymal stem cells, resulting in decreased hematopoietic-supporting capacity of bone marrow CD34(+)cells. Furthermore, the reduction of hematopoietic growth factors including Jagged-1, stem cell factor and angiopoietin-1 were reverted by target protection of poly(rC) binding protein 1, suggesting that poly(rC) binding protein 1 could be involved in the stabilization of several growth factors. Thus, miR-7977 in extracellular vesicles may be a critical factor that induces failure of normal hematopoiesis via poly(rC) binding protein 1 suppression.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Angiopoietin-1, Bone Marrow Cells, Coculture Techniques, DNA-Binding Proteins, Extracellular Vesicles, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Hematopoiesis, Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins, Humans, Jagged-1 Protein, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Lymphoma, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, MicroRNAs, Molecular Mimicry, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Neoplasm Staging, Oligoribonucleotides, Primary Cell Culture, RNA-Binding Proteins, Signal Transduction, Stem Cell Factor, Transfection",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE64029']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE64029

In the multicenter CBF-2006 study, a prospective monitoring of peripheral blood and bone marrow samples was performed every 3 months and every year, respectively, for 2 years following intensive chemotherapy in 94 patients in first complete remission. A complete molecular remission was defined as a (RUNX1-RUNX1T1/ABL1)×100 ≤ 0.001%. After the completion of consolidation therapy, a bone marrow complete molecular remission was observed in 30% of the patients, but was not predictive of subsequent relapse. Indeed, 8 patients (9%) presented a positive bone marrow minimal residual disease for up to 2 years of follow-up while still remaining in complete remission. Conversely, a peripheral blood complete molecular remission was statistically associated with a lower risk of relapse whatever the time-point considered after the completion of consolidation therapy. During the 2-year follow-up, the persistence of peripheral blood complete molecular remission was associated with a lower risk of relapse (4-year cumulative incidence, 8.2%), while molecular relapse confirmed on a subsequent peripheral blood sample predicted hematological relapse (4-year cumulative incidence, 86.9%) within a median time interval of 3.9 months. In t(8;21)(q22;q22) acute myeloid leukemia, minimal residual disease monitoring on peripheral blood every 3 months allows for the prediction of hematological relapse, and to identify patients who could potentially benefit from intervention therapy.

Here, we demonstrate that the AML maintenance function of BRD4 requires its interaction with NSD3, which belongs to a subfamily of H3K36 methyltransferases. Unexpectedly, AML cells were found to only require a short isoform of NSD3 that lacks the methyltransferase domain. We show that NSD3-short is an adaptor protein that sustains leukemia by linking BRD4 to the CHD8 chromatin remodeler, by using a PWWP chromatin reader module, and by employing an acidic transactivation domain. Genetic targeting of NSD3 or CHD8 mimics the phenotypic and transcriptional effects of BRD4 inhibition. Furthermore, BRD4, NSD3, and CHD8 colocalize across the AML genome, and each is released from super-enhancer regions upon chemical inhibition of BET bromodomains. These findings suggest that BET inhibitors exert therapeutic effects in leukemia by evicting BRD4-NSD3-CHD8 complexes from chromatin to suppress transcription.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Catalytic Domain, Cell Cycle Proteins, Cell Proliferation, Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly, DNA-Binding Proteins, HL-60 Cells, Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Nuclear Proteins, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Protein Isoforms, Transcription Factors",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE71183', 'GSE71185', 'GSE71186']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE71183

Here, we show that mutant cohesin proteins block differentiation of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vitro and in vivo and enforce stem cell programs. These effects are restricted to immature HSPC populations, where cohesin mutants show increased chromatin accessibility and likelihood of transcription factor binding site occupancy by HSPC regulators including ERG, GATA2, and RUNX1, as measured by ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq.

Using murine MLL-AF9 and MOZ-TIF2 AML models, we show that myeloid differentiation to granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMPs) is critical for LSC generation. Disrupting GMP formation by deleting the lineage-restricted transcription factor C/EBPa blocked normal granulocyte formation and prevented initiation of AML. However, restoring myeloid differentiation in C/EBPa mutants with inflammatory cytokines reestablished AML transformation capacity. Genomic analyses of GMPs, including gene expression and H3K79me2 profiling in conjunction with ATAC-seq, revealed a permissive genomic environment for activation of a minimal transcription program shared by GMPs and LSCs.

Therefore, we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the similarities and differences in genes and pathways between these subtypes of pediatric AMLs. Diagnostic RNA from patients with t(8;21) (N = 17), Inv(16) (N = 14), and normal karyotype (NK, N = 33) were subjected to RNA-seq. Analyses compared the transcriptomes across these three cytogenetic subtypes, using the NK cohort as the control. A total of 1291 genes in t(8;21) and 474 genes in Inv(16) were differentially expressed relative to the NK controls, with 198 genes differentially expressed in both subtypes. The majority of these genes (175/198; binomial test p-value < 10(-30)) are consistent in expression changes among the two subtypes suggesting the expression profiles are more similar between the CBF cohorts than in the NK cohort. Our analysis also revealed alternative splicing events (ASEs) differentially expressed across subtypes, with 337 t(8;21)-specific and 407 Inv(16)-specific ASEs detected, the majority of which were acetylated proteins (p = 1.5 x 10(-51) and p = 1.8 x 10(-54) for the two subsets). In addition to known fusions, we identified and verified 16 de novo fusions in 43 patients, including three fusions involving NUP98 in six patients. Clustering of differentially expressed genes indicated that the homeobox (HOX) gene family, including two transcription factors (MEIS1 and NKX2-3) were down-regulated in CBF compared to NK samples. This finding supports existing data that the dysregulation of HOX genes play a central role in biology CBF-AML hematopoiesis. These data provide comprehensive transcriptome profiling of CBF-AML and delineate genes and pathways that are differentially expressed, providing insights into the shared biology as well as differences in the two CBF subsets.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Acetylation, Alternative Splicing, Binding Sites, Chromosome Inversion, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8, Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit, Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits, Core Binding Factor beta Subunit, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Regulatory Networks, Homeodomain Proteins, Humans, Karyotyping, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein, Neoplasm Proteins, Principal Component Analysis, Protein Binding, Sequence Analysis, RNA, Transcription Factors, Transcriptome, Translocation, Genetic",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'dbGaP', 'AccessionNumberList': ['PHS000465.V10.P3']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'})]",dbGaP,PHS000465.V10.P3

CD47 serves as the ligand for a receptor on these innate immune cells, SIRP-alpha, which in turn delivers an inhibitory signal for phagocytosis. We previously found increased expression of CD47 on primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) stem cells, and demonstrated that blocking monoclonal antibodies directed against CD47 enabled the phagocytosis and elimination of AML, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and many solid tumors in xenograft models. Here, we report the development of a humanized anti-CD47 antibody with potent efficacy and favorable toxicokinetic properties as a candidate therapeutic. A novel monoclonal anti-human CD47 antibody, 5F9, was generated, and antibody humanization was carried out by grafting its complementarity determining regions (CDRs) onto a human IgG4 format. The resulting humanized 5F9 antibody (Hu5F9-G4) bound monomeric human CD47 with an 8 nM affinity. Hu5F9-G4 induced potent macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of primary human AML cells in vitro and completely eradicated human AML in vivo, leading to long-term disease-free survival of patient-derived xenografts. Moreover, Hu5F9-G4 synergized with rituximab to eliminate NHL engraftment and cure xenografted mice. Finally, toxicokinetic studies in non-human primates showed that Hu5F9-G4 could be safely administered intravenously at doses able to achieve potentially therapeutic serum levels. Thus, Hu5F9-G4 is actively being developed for and has been entered into clinical trials in patients with AML and solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02216409).","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized, Antibody Affinity, Antineoplastic Agents, CD47 Antigen, Female, Haplorhini, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Macaca fascicularis, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Phagocytosis, Rituximab, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'ClinicalTrials.gov', 'AccessionNumberList': ['NCT02216409']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02216409

Here, we show that acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) with genomic rearrangements of the MLL gene contain a non-quiescent LSC population. Although human CD34(+)CD38(-) LSCs are generally highly quiescent, the C-type lectin CD93 is expressed on a subset of actively cycling, non-quiescent AML cells enriched for LSC activity. CD93 expression is functionally required for engraftment of primary human AML LSCs and leukemogenesis, and it regulates LSC self-renewal predominantly by silencing CDKN2B, a major tumor suppressor in AML.

While clinical trials have reported single-agent activity in advanced haematological malignancies, mechanisms determining the response to BET inhibition remain poorly understood. To identify factors involved in primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, here we perform a chromatin-focused RNAi screen in a sensitive MLL-AF9;Nras(G12D)-driven AML mouse model, and investigate dynamic transcriptional profiles in sensitive and resistant mouse and human leukaemias. Our screen shows that suppression of the PRC2 complex, contrary to effects in other contexts, promotes BET inhibitor resistance in AML. PRC2 suppression does not directly affect the regulation of Brd4-dependent transcripts, but facilitates the remodelling of regulatory pathways that restore the transcription of key targets such as Myc. Similarly, while BET inhibition triggers acute MYC repression in human leukaemias regardless of their sensitivity, resistant leukaemias are uniformly characterized by their ability to rapidly restore MYC transcription. This process involves the activation and recruitment of WNT signalling components, which compensate for the loss of BRD4 and drive resistance in various cancer models. Dynamic chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing of enhancer profiles reveal that BET-resistant states are characterized by remodelled regulatory landscapes, involving the activation of a focal MYC enhancer that recruits WNT machinery in response to BET inhibition. Together, our results identify and validate WNT signalling as a driver and candidate biomarker of primary and acquired BET resistance in leukaemia, and implicate the rewiring of transcriptional programs as an important mechanism promoting resistance to BET inhibitors and, potentially, other chromatin-targeted therapies.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Azepines, Cell Cycle Proteins, Cell Line, Tumor, Chromatin, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, Enhancer Elements, Genetic, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genes, myc, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Mice, Nuclear Proteins, Transcription Factors, Transcription, Genetic, Triazoles, Wnt Signaling Pathway",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE63782']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE63782

Early clinical trials have shown promise, especially in acute myeloid leukaemia, and therefore the evaluation of resistance mechanisms is crucial to optimize the clinical efficacy of these drugs. Here we use primary mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells immortalized with the fusion protein MLL-AF9 to generate several single-cell clones that demonstrate resistance, in vitro and in vivo, to the prototypical BET inhibitor, I-BET. Resistance to I-BET confers cross-resistance to chemically distinct BET inhibitors such as JQ1, as well as resistance to genetic knockdown of BET proteins. Resistance is not mediated through increased drug efflux or metabolism, but is shown to emerge from leukaemia stem cells both ex vivo and in vivo. Chromatin-bound BRD4 is globally reduced in resistant cells, whereas the expression of key target genes such as Myc remains unaltered, highlighting the existence of alternative mechanisms to regulate transcription. We demonstrate that resistance to BET inhibitors, in human and mouse leukaemia cells, is in part a consequence of increased Wnt/β-catenin signalling, and negative regulation of this pathway results in restoration of sensitivity to I-BET in vitro and in vivo.

Furthermore, CHD4 depletion renders AML blasts more sensitive both in vitro and in vivo to genotoxic agents used in clinical therapy: daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (ara-C). Sensitization to DNR and ara-C is mediated in part by activation of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated pathway, which is preliminarily activated by a Tip60-dependent mechanism in response to chromatin relaxation and further activated by genotoxic agent-induced DSBs. This sensitization preferentially affects AML cells, as CHD4 depletion in normal CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors does not increase their susceptibility to DNR or ara-C. Unexpectedly, we found that CHD4 is necessary for maintaining the tumor-forming behavior of AML cells, as CHD4 depletion severely restricted the ability of AML cells to form xenografts in mice and colonies in soft agar.

However, Tspan3 deletion impaired leukemia stem cell self-renewal and disease propagation and markedly improved survival in mouse models of AML. Additionally, Tspan3 inhibition blocked growth of AML patient samples, suggesting that Tspan3 is also important in human disease. As part of the mechanism, we show that Tspan3 deficiency disabled responses to CXCL12/SDF-1 and led to defects in AML localization within the niche.

The molecular mechanisms underlying p30-mediated transformation remain incompletely understood. We show that C/EBPα p30, but not the normal p42 isoform, preferentially interacts with Wdr5, a key component of SET/MLL (SET-domain/mixed-lineage leukemia) histone-methyltransferase complexes. Accordingly, p30-bound genomic regions were enriched for MLL-dependent H3K4me3 marks.

Study patients received an induction with idarubicin (8 mg/m(2) iv days 1-3) plus cytarabine (100 mg/m(2) iv days 1-7) plus panobinostat po at escalating doses (days 8, 10, 12, 15, 17 and 19) that could be repeated in non-responding patients.

Thirty-one patients were treated at the maximum tolerated dose of panobinostat in the combination (10 mg) with good tolerability. Complete remission rate was 64% with a time to relapse of 17.0 months (12.8-21.1). Median overall survival for the whole series was 17 months (5.5-28.4). Moreover, in 4 of 5 patients with persistent minimal residual disease before maintenance, panobinostat monotherapy reduced its levels, with complete negativization in two of them.

In this study, we analyzed epigenetic aging signatures in 5,621 DNAm profiles of 25 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Overall, age-associated DNAm patterns hardly reflect chronological age of cancer patients, but they are coherently modified in a non-stochastic manner, particularly at CpGs that become hypermethylated upon aging in non-malignant tissues. This coordinated regulation in epigenetic aging signatures can therefore be used for aberrant epigenetic age-predictions, which facilitate disease stratification. For example, in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) higher epigenetic age-predictions are associated with increased incidence of mutations in RUNX1, WT1, and IDH2, whereas mutations in TET2, TP53, and PML-PARA translocation are more frequent in younger age-predictions. Furthermore, epigenetic aging signatures correlate with overall survival in several types of cancer (such as lower grade glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, esophageal carcinoma, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, and neuroendocrine neoplasms). In conclusion, age-associated DNAm patterns in cancer are not related to chronological age of the patient, but they are coordinately regulated, particularly at CpGs that become hypermethylated in normal aging. Furthermore, the apparent epigenetic age-predictions correlate with clinical parameters and overall survival in several types of cancer, indicating that regulation of DNAm patterns in age-associated CpGs is relevant for cancer development.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Aging, CpG Islands, DNA Methylation, Databases, Genetic, Epigenesis, Genetic, Esophageal Neoplasms, Female, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Middle Aged, Mutation, Neoplasms, Prognosis, Reference Values",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE40279']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE40279

To test the hypothesis that haploidentical HSCT would be a valid option as postremission therapy for AML patients in CR1 lacking a matched donor, we designed a disease-specific, prospective, multicenter study. Between July 2010 and November 2013, 450 patients were assigned to undergo HID (231 patients) or ISD HSCT (219 patients) according to donor availability. Among HID and ISD recipients, the 3-year disease-free survival rate was 74% and 78% (P = .34), respectively; the overall survival rate was 79% and 82% (P = .36), respectively; cumulative incidences of relapse were 15% and 15% (P = .98); and those of the nonrelapse-mortality were 13% and 8% (P = .13), respectively.

We investigated the role of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) counteracting and recognizing LSC. Leukemia-associated antigens (LAA) represent immunogenic structures to target LSC. We enriched the LSC-containing fraction of 20 AML patients and hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) of healthy volunteers. Using microarray analysis and qRT-PCR we detected high expression of several LAA in AML cells but also in LSC. PRAME (p = 0.0085), RHAMM (p = 0.03), WT1 (p = 0.04) and Proteinase 3 (p = 0.04) showed significant differential expression in LSC compared with HSC. PRAME, RHAMM and WT1 are furthermore also lower expressed on leukemic bulk. In contrast, Proteinase 3 indicates a higher expression on leukemic bulk than on LSC. In colony forming unit (CFU) immunoassays, T cells stimulated against various LAA indicated a significant inhibition of CFUs in AML patient samples. The LAA PRAME, RHAMM and WT1 showed highest immunogenic responses with a range up to 58-83%. In a proof of principle xenotransplant mouse model, PRAME-stimulated CTL targeted AML stem cells, reflected by a delayed engraftment of leukemia (p = 0.0159). Taken together, we demonstrated the expression of several LAA in LSC. LAA-specific T cells are able to hamper LSC in immunoassays and in a mouse model, which suggests that immunotherapeutic approaches have the potential to target malignant stem cells.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Antigens, Neoplasm, Cell Survival, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Inbred NOD, Mice, SCID, Neoplasm Transplantation, Neoplastic Stem Cells, T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic, Tumor Cells, Cultured","ListElement([StringElement('AML', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('cytotoxic T cells', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('leukemia associated antigens', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('leukemic stem cells', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('therapeutic targets', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE68172']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE68172

Adult patients with refractory AML were enrolled in the study and received fludarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin (FLAG-IDA) as cytoreductive chemotherapy followed by busulfan and fludarabine (Flu-BU) conditioning regimen and transfusion of mobilized peripheral stem cells from human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling or unrelated donor. The primary endpoint of the study was 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and secondary endpoints included complete-remission rate, 2-year overall survival (OS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and relapse rate. A total of 16 patients were enrolled with median age of 36 (16-60), which included 9 primary induction failure, 2 early relapse, and 5 with relapse/refractory disease. The median cycles of previous chemotherapy were 4 (3-10) with a median of 55% (1%-90%) blasts in bone marrow.

Belinostat (Bel, PXD101), a hydroxamate-type HDACi, has proved to be a promising cure in clinical trials for solid tumours and haematological malignancies. However, insight into molecular effects of Bel on APL, is still lacking. In this study, we investigated the effect of Bel alone and in combination with differentiation inducer retinoic acid (RA) on human promyelocytic leukaemia NB4 and HL-60 cells. We found that treatment with Bel, depending on the dosage used, inhibits cell proliferation, whereas in combination with RA enhances and accelerates granulocytic leukaemia cell differentiation. We also evaluated the effect of used treatments with Bel and RA on certain epigenetic modifiers (HDAC1, HDAC2, PCAF) as well as cell cycle regulators (p27) gene expression and protein level modulation. We showed that Bel in combination with RA up-regulates basal histone H4 hyperacetylation level more strongly compared to Bel or RA alone. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that Bel induces the accumulation of hyperacetylated histone H4 at the p27 promoter region. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that in control NB4 cells, hyperacetylated histone H4 is mainly found in association with proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription, whereas after Bel treatment it is found with proteins implicated in pro-apoptotic processes, in defence against oxidative stress and tumour suppression.

We investigated the potential relationship between pre-hospitalization exposure to sources of fungi and the development of invasive fungal infections in adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia after their first course of chemotherapy. From January 2010 to April 2012, all consecutive acute myeloid leukemia patients in 33 Italian centers were prospectively registered. Upon first admission, information about possible pre-chemotherapy risk factors and environmental exposure was collected. We recorded data regarding comorbid conditions, employment, hygienic habits, working and living environment, personal habits, hobbies, and pets. All invasive fungal infections occurring within 30 days after the first course of chemotherapy were recorded. Of the 1,192 patients enrolled in this study, 881 received intensive chemotherapy and were included in the present analysis. Of these, 214 developed an invasive fungal infection, including 77 proven/probable cases (8.7%). Of these 77 cases, 54 were proven/probable invasive mold infections (6.1%) and 23 were proven yeast infections (2.6%). Upon univariate analysis, a significant association was found between invasive mold infections and age, performance status, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, cocaine use, job, hobbies, and a recent house renovation. Higher body weight resulted in a reduced risk of invasive mold infections. Multivariate analysis confirmed the role of performance status, job, body weight, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and house renovation. In conclusion, several hospital-independent variables could potentially influence the onset of invasive mold infections in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Investigation of these factors upon first admission may help to define a patient's risk category and improve targeted prophylactic strategies.

This open-label dose escalation study assessed the safety and pharmacokinetics of intravenous isavuconazole prophylaxis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia who had undergone chemotherapy and had preexisting/expected neutropenia. Twenty-four patients were enrolled, and 20 patients completed the study. The patients in the low-dose cohort (n = 11) received isavuconazole loading doses on day 1 (400/200/200 mg, 6 h apart) and day 2 (200/200 mg, 12 h apart), followed by once-daily maintenance dosing (200 mg) on days 3 to 28. The loading and maintenance doses were doubled in the high-dose cohort (n = 12). The mean ± standard deviation plasma isavuconazole areas under the concentration-time curves for the dosing period on day 7 were 60.1 ± 22.3 μg · h/ml and 113.1 ± 19.6 μg · h/ml for the patients in the low-dose and high-dose cohorts, respectively. The adverse events in five patients in the low-dose cohort and in eight patients in the high-dose cohort were considered to be drug related. Most were mild to moderate in severity, and the most common adverse events were headache and rash (n = 3 each).

Using the Src family kinase Lyn SH2 domain as a model, we found that phosphorylation at the conserved SH2 domain residue Y(194) impacts the affinity and specificity of SH2 domain binding to pY-containing peptides and proteins. Analysis of the Lyn SH2 domain crystal structure supports a model wherein phosphorylation of Y(194) on the EF loop modulates the binding pocket that engages amino acid side chains at the pY+2/+3 position.

In acute myeloid leukemia, acquired cytogenetic abnormalities are important independent predictors of initial response to therapy, remission duration, and overall survival. However, whether the presence of multiple cytogenetically characterized clones affects outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia is still not well defined. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of cytogenetic clonal heterogeneity in acute myeloid leukemia. This analysis included 1403 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients fit for intensive chemotherapy, aged between 15 and 88 years, enrolled on Southwest Oncology Group protocols. The presence of multiple cytogenetic clones was found in 164 (24%) patients with abnormal karyotype. The proportion of patients with clonal heterogeneity increased with age, being present in 20% of patients under 40 years of age, but in 30% of those aged over 70 years (P=0.03). Clonal heterogeneity was significantly more common in association with unfavorable karyotype. Clonal heterogeneity was associated with decreased response rates and inferior event-free, relapse-free and overall survival, and was confirmed as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in multivariable analysis.

LncRNAs are involved in numerous biological roles including imprinting, epigenetic regulation, apoptosis, and cell cycle. To determine whether lncRNAs are associated with clinical features and recurrent mutations in older patients (aged ≥60 y) with cytogenetically normal (CN) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we evaluated lncRNA expression in 148 untreated older CN-AML cases using a custom microarray platform. An independent set of 71 untreated older patients with CN-AML was used to validate the outcome scores using RNA sequencing. Distinctive lncRNA profiles were found associated with selected mutations, such as internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) and mutations in the NPM1, CEBPA, IDH2, ASXL1, and RUNX1 genes. Using the lncRNAs most associated with event-free survival in a training cohort of 148 older patients with CN-AML, we derived a lncRNA score composed of 48 lncRNAs. Patients with an unfavorable compared with favorable lncRNA score had a lower complete response (CR) rate [P < 0.001, odds ratio = 0.14, 54% vs. 89%], shorter disease-free survival (DFS) [P < 0.001, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.88] and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001, HR = 2.95). The validation set analyses confirmed these results (CR, P = 0.03; DFS, P = 0.009; OS, P = 0.009). Multivariable analyses for CR, DFS, and OS identified the lncRNA score as an independent marker for outcome. In conclusion, lncRNA expression in AML is closely associated with recurrent mutations. A small subset of lncRNAs is correlated strongly with treatment response and survival.","Clinical Trial, Journal Article, Multicenter Study, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Case-Control Studies, Disease-Free Survival, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Middle Aged, Mutation, Neoplasm Proteins, Nucleophosmin, RNA, Long Noncoding, RNA, Neoplasm, Sequence Analysis, RNA, Survival Rate","ListElement([StringElement('acute myeloid leukemia', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('lncRNAs', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('outcome', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE63614', 'GSE63646']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Clinical Trial', attributes={'UI': 'D016430'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Multicenter Study', attributes={'UI': 'D016448'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE63614

There are several features that distinguish t-AML from de novo AML, including a higher incidence of TP53 mutations, abnormalities of chromosomes 5 or 7, complex cytogenetics and a reduced response to chemotherapy. However, it is not clear how prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy influences leukaemogenesis. In particular, the mechanism by which TP53 mutations are selectively enriched in t-AML/t-MDS is unknown. Here, by sequencing the genomes of 22 patients with t-AML, we show that the total number of somatic single-nucleotide variants and the percentage of chemotherapy-related transversions are similar in t-AML and de novo AML, indicating that previous chemotherapy does not induce genome-wide DNA damage. We identified four cases of t-AML/t-MDS in which the exact TP53 mutation found at diagnosis was also present at low frequencies (0.003-0.7%) in mobilized blood leukocytes or bone marrow 3-6 years before the development of t-AML/t-MDS, including two cases in which the relevant TP53 mutation was detected before any chemotherapy. Moreover, functional TP53 mutations were identified in small populations of peripheral blood cells of healthy chemotherapy-naive elderly individuals. Finally, in mouse bone marrow chimaeras containing both wild-type and Tp53(+/-) haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), the Tp53(+/-) HSPCs preferentially expanded after exposure to chemotherapy. These data suggest that cytotoxic therapy does not directly induce TP53 mutations. Rather, they support a model in which rare HSPCs carrying age-related TP53 mutations are resistant to chemotherapy and expand preferentially after treatment. The early acquisition of TP53 mutations in the founding HSPC clone probably contributes to the frequent cytogenetic abnormalities and poor responses to chemotherapy that are typical of patients with t-AML/t-MDS.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Alleles, Animals, Cell Lineage, Cell Proliferation, Clone Cells, DNA Damage, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, Ethylnitrosourea, Evolution, Molecular, Genes, p53, Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Heterozygote, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Models, Genetic, Mutation",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'dbGaP', 'AccessionNumberList': ['PHS000159']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",dbGaP,PHS000159

We show that H3K79 methyltransferase activity as well as H3K79me1-to-H3K79me2 conversion is regulated by the DOT1L cofactor AF10. AF10 inactivation reverses leukemia-associated epigenetic profiles, precludes abnormal HOXA gene expression, and impairs the transforming ability of MLL-AF9, MLL-AF6, and NUP98-NSD1 fusions-mechanistically distinct HOX-activating oncogenes. Furthermore, NUP98-NSD1-transformed cells are sensitive to small-molecule inhibition of DOT1L.

From 2007 to 2009, 79 UCBT recipients were enrolled. Patients who underwent transplantation in first complete remission (CR1) (n = 48) had a higher frequency of unfavorable cytogenetics and secondary AML and required more induction courses of chemotherapy to achieve CR1 compared with the others. The median infused total nucleated cells (TNC) was 3.4 × 10(7)/kg, 60% received double UCBT, 77% were HLA mismatched (4/6), and 40% had major ABO incompatibility. Cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery at day 60 was 87% and the cumulative incidence of 100-day acute graft-versus-host disease (II to IV) was 50%. At 2 years, the cumulative incidence of NRM and relapse was 20% and 46%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, major ABO incompatibility (P = .001) and TNC (<3.4 × 10(7)/kg; P = .001) were associated with increased NRM, and use of 2 or more induction courses to obtain CR1 was associated with increased relapse incidence (P = .04). Leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years was 35%, and the only factor associated with decreased LFS was secondary AML (P = .04).

To address this, we generated a mouse model in which the mixed-lineage leukemia/eleven-nineteen-leukemia (MLL-ENL) transcription factor can be conditionally activated in any cell type. We show that AML can originate from multiple hematopoietic progenitor subsets with granulocytic and monocytic potential, and that the normal developmental position of leukemia-initiating cells influences leukemic development. However, disease failed to arise from HSCs. Although it maintained or upregulated the expression of target genes associated with leukemic development, MLL-ENL dysregulated the proliferative and repopulating capacity of HSCs. Therefore, the permissiveness for development of AML may be associated with a narrower window of differentiation than was previously appreciated, and hijacking the self-renewal capacity of HSCs by a potent oncogene is insufficient for leukemic development.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Carcinogenesis, Cell Differentiation, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Cytoprotection, Disease Models, Animal, Doxycycline, Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic, Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Mice, Transgenic, Myeloid Progenitor Cells, Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein, Oncogene Proteins, Fusion, Reproducibility of Results, Transcription, Genetic",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE62734']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE62734

We conducted a phase I trial of maintenance sorafenib after HSCT in patients with FLT3-ITD AML (ClinicalTrials.govNCT01398501). Patients received a variety of conditioning regimens and graft sources. A dose escalation 3 + 3 cohort design was used to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), with an additional 10 patients treated at the MTD. Sorafenib was initiated between days 45 and 120 after HSCT and continued for 12 28-day cycles. Twenty-two patients were enrolled (status at HSCT: first complete remission [CR1], n = 16; second complete remission [CR2], n = 3; refractory, n = 3). The MTD was established at 400 mg twice daily with 1 dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) observed (pericardial effusion). Two patients died of transplantation-related causes, both unrelated to sorafenib. Two patients stopped sorafenib after relapse and 5 stopped because of attributable toxicities after the DLT period. Median follow-up for surviving patients is 16.7 months after HSCT (range, 8.1 to 35.0). There was 1 case of grade II acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after starting sorafenib and the 12-month cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 38% (90% confidence interval [CI], 21% to 56%).

Reduced miR-146a expression in del(5q) HR MDS/AML and miR-146a(-/-) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) results in TRAF6/NF-κB activation. Increased survival and proliferation of HSPCs from miR-146a(low) HR MDS/AML is sustained by a neighboring haploid gene, SQSTM1 (p62), expressed from the intact 5q allele. Overexpression of p62 from the intact allele occurs through NF-κB-dependent feedforward signaling mediated by miR-146a deficiency. p62 is necessary for TRAF6-mediated NF-κB signaling, as disrupting the p62-TRAF6 signaling complex results in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of MDS/AML cells. Thus, del(5q) HR MDS/AML employs an intrachromosomal gene network involving loss of miR-146a and haploid overexpression of p62 via NF-κB to sustain TRAF6/NF-κB signaling for cell survival and proliferation.

Since the regenerative capacity of normal haematopoietic stem cells is limited by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and DNA double-strand breaks, we speculated that DNA damage might also constrain leukaemic self-renewal and malignant haematopoiesis. Here we show that the histone methyl-transferase MLL4, a suppressor of B-cell lymphoma, is required for stem-cell activity and an aggressive form of acute myeloid leukaemia harbouring the MLL-AF9 oncogene. Deletion of MLL4 enhances myelopoiesis and myeloid differentiation of leukaemic blasts, which protects mice from death related to acute myeloid leukaemia. MLL4 exerts its function by regulating transcriptional programs associated with the antioxidant response. Addition of reactive oxygen species scavengers or ectopic expression of FOXO3 protects MLL4(-/-) MLL-AF9 cells from DNA damage and inhibits myeloid maturation. Similar to MLL4 deficiency, loss of ATM or BRCA1 sensitizes transformed cells to differentiation, suggesting that myeloid differentiation is promoted by loss of genome integrity. Indeed, we show that restriction-enzyme-induced double-strand breaks are sufficient to induce differentiation of MLL-AF9 blasts, which requires cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Cip1) (Cdkn1a) activity. In summary, we have uncovered an unexpected tumour-promoting role of genome guardians in enforcing the oncogene-induced differentiation blockade in acute myeloid leukaemia.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins, BRCA1 Protein, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21, DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded, DNA Damage, DNA Repair, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genes, BRCA1, Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Mice, Myelopoiesis, Oncogene Proteins, Fusion, Reactive Oxygen Species",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE57147']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052060'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE57147

Recent studies have shown that EZH2 mutations are often associated with RUNX1 mutations in MDS patients, although its pathological function remains to be addressed. Here we establish an MDS mouse model by transducing a RUNX1S291fs mutant into hematopoietic stem cells and subsequently deleting Ezh2. Ezh2 loss significantly promotes RUNX1S291fs-induced MDS. Despite their compromised proliferative capacity of RUNX1S291fs/Ezh2-null MDS cells, MDS bone marrow impairs normal hematopoietic cells via selectively activating inflammatory cytokine responses, thereby allowing propagation of MDS clones. In contrast, loss of Ezh2 prevents the transformation of AML via PRC1-mediated repression of Hoxa9.

We previously reported on the efficacy and safety of azacitidine in 155 AML patients treated within the Austrian Azacitidine Registry (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01595295). We herein update this report with a population almost twice as large (n = 302). This cohort included 172 patients with >30 % BM blasts; 93 % would have been excluded from the pivotal AZA-001 trial (which led to European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval of azacitidine for high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML with 20-30 % BM blasts). Despite this much more unfavorable profile, results are encouraging: overall response rate was 48 % in the total cohort and 72 % in patients evaluable according to MDS-IWG-2006 response criteria, respectively. Median OS was 9.6 (95 % CI 8.53-10.7) months. A clinically relevant OS benefit was observed with any form of disease stabilization (marrow stable disease (8.1 months), hematologic improvement (HI) (9.7 months), or the combination thereof (18.9 months)), as compared to patients without response and/or without disease stabilization (3.2 months). Age, white blood cell count, and BM blast count at start of therapy did not influence OS. The baseline factors LDH >225 U/l, ECOG ≥2, comorbidities ≥3, monosomal karyotype, and prior disease-modifying drugs, as well as the response-related factors hematologic improvement and further deepening of response after first response, were significant independent predictors of OS in multivariate analysis. Azacitidine seems effective in WHO-AML, including patients with >30 % BM blasts (currently off-label use).

Post-treatment serial PET/CT tracked the localization of CIK cells over time: at 1 h, the majority of these cells accumulated diffusely in the lungs, while the first minor cell activities were observed in brain, liver and spleen; at 4 and 8 h, they not only migrated to the heart, spleen, and liver, but also showed tendencies to accumulate in bone marrow and brain. This specific cell migration route suggested that CIK cells show in vivo functional kinesis and potency as a targeted immunotherapy.

In studies designed to define neoplastic stem cells of primary myelofibrosis (PMF), a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by profound disruption of the hematopoietic microenvironment, we observed a high frequency of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in NSG mice. AML was of mouse origin, confined to PMF-xenografted mice, and contained multiple clonal integrations of ecotropic murine leukemia virus (E-MuLV). Significantly, MuLV replication was not only observed in diseased mice, but also in nontreated NSG controls. Furthermore, in addition to the single ecotropic endogenous retrovirus (eERV) located on chromosome 11 (Emv30) in the NOD genome, multiple de novo germ-line eERV integrations were observed in mice from each of four independent NSG mouse colonies. Analysis confirmed that E-MuLV originated from the Emv30 provirus and that recombination events were not necessary for virus replication or AML induction. Pathogenicity is thus likely attributable to PMF-mediated paracrine stimulation of mouse myeloid cells, which serve as targets for retroviral infection and transformation, as evidenced by integration into the Evi1 locus, a hotspot for retroviral-induced myeloid leukemia. This study thus corroborates a role of paracrine stimulation in PMF disease progression, underlines the importance of target cell type and numbers in MuLV-induced disease, and mandates awareness of replicating MuLV in NOD immunodeficient mice, which can significantly influence experimental results and their interpretation.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Aged, Animals, Blotting, Southern, Endogenous Retroviruses, Female, Humans, Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit, Leukemia Virus, Murine, Leukemia, Experimental, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Mice, Inbred NOD, Mice, Knockout, Mice, SCID, Mice, Transgenic, Middle Aged, Molecular Sequence Data, Primary Myelofibrosis, Proviruses, Transplantation, Heterologous, Virus Integration, Virus Replication, Young Adult",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['KJ668269', 'KJ668270', 'KJ668271']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,KJ668269

Here, we report that AML is dependent on DDX5 and that inhibiting DDX5 expression slows AML cell proliferation in vitro and AML progression in vivo but is not toxic to cells from normal bone marrow. Inhibition of DDX5 expression in AML cells induces apoptosis via induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This apoptotic response can be blocked either by BCL2 overexpression or treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Combining DDX5 knockdown with a BCL2 family inhibitor cooperates to induce cell death in AML cells. By inhibiting DDX5 expression in vivo, we show that DDX5 is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis and tissue homeostasis.

In this study we investigated the prognostic potential of minimal residual disease monitoring by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of NPM1 mutations in patients treated in the AMLCG 1999, 2004 and 2008 trials. Minimal residual disease was monitored - in aplasia, after induction therapy, after consolidation therapy, and during follow-up - in 588 samples from 158 patients positive for NPM1 mutations A, B and D (with a sensitivity of 10(-6)). One hundred and twenty-seven patients (80.4%) achieved complete remission after induction therapy and, of these, 56 patients (44.1%) relapsed. At each checkpoint, minimal residual disease cut-offs were calculated. After induction therapy a cut-off NPM1 mutation ratio of 0.01 was associated with a high hazard ratio of 4.26 and the highest sensitivity of 76% for the prediction of relapse. This was reflected in a cumulative incidence of relapse after 2 years of 77.8% for patients with ratios above the cut-off versus 26.4% for those with ratios below the cut-off. In the favorable subgroup according to European LeukemiaNet, the cut-off after induction therapy also separated the cohort into two prognostic groups with a cumulative incidence of relapse of 76% versus 6% after 2 years. Our data demonstrate that in addition to pre-therapeutic factors, the course of minimal residual disease in an individual is an important prognostic factor and could be included in clinical trials for the guidance of post-remission therapy.

Between 2004 and 2006, 186 patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 induction cycles with idarubicin, cytarabine, and all-trans retinoic acid either with VPA or without (STANDARD).

The main toxicities attributed to VPA were delayed hematologic recovery and grade 3/4 infections, observed predominantly during the second induction cycle. After restricting VPA to the first induction cycle and reducing the dose of idarubicin, these toxicities dropped to rates observed in STANDARD. After a median follow-up time of 84 months, event-free and overall survival were not different between the 2 groups (P = .95 and P = .57, respectively).

To our knowledge, TBLR1-RARα is the 10th RARα chimeric gene that has been reported up to now. TBLR1-RARα contained the B-F domains of RARα and exhibited a distinct subcellular localization. It could form homodimers and also heterodimers with retinoid X receptor α. As a result, TBLR1-RARα exhibited diminished transcriptional activity by recruitment of more transcriptional corepressors compared with RARα. In the presence of pharmacologic doses of ATRA, TBLR1-RARα could be degraded, and its homodimerization was abrogated. Moreover, when treated with ATRA, TBLR1-RARα could mediate the dissociation and degradation of transcriptional corepressors, consequent transactivation of RARα target genes, and cell differentiation induction in a dose- and time-dependent manner.","Case Reports, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Amino Acid Sequence, Antineoplastic Agents, Base Sequence, Cell Differentiation, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3, Cloning, Molecular, DNA, Neoplasm, HEK293 Cells, Humans, Karyotyping, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Male, Middle Aged, Molecular Sequence Data, Nuclear Proteins, Oncogene Proteins, Fusion, Protein Multimerization, Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear, Receptors, Retinoic Acid, Repressor Proteins, Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha, Trans-Activators, Translocation, Genetic, Tretinoin",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['KF589333']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Case Reports', attributes={'UI': 'D002363'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,KF589333

We used an expanded cohort of 1532 T cell-replete transplants to examine the interaction between donor KIR B genes and recipient class I HLA KIR ligands. The relapse protection associated with donor KIR B is enhanced in recipients who have one or two C1-bearing HLA-C allotypes, compared with C2 homozygous recipients, with no effect due to donor HLA. The protective interaction between donors with two or more, versus none or one, KIR B motifs and recipient C1 was specific to transplants with class I mismatch at HLA-C (RR of leukemia-free survival, 0.57 [0.40-0.79]; p = 0.001) irrespective of the KIR ligand mismatch status of the transplant. The survival advantage and relapse protection in C1/x recipients compared with C2/C2 recipients was similar irrespective of the particular donor KIR B genes.

The goal was to determine efficacy and identify patient subgroups that may benefit from CPX-351 treatment. Response rate (complete remission + incomplete remission) was the primary end point, with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) as secondary end points.

Risk factor analysis for the occurrence of CDI was performed by backward-stepwise logistic regression (P < .1). During the period from January 2007 to August 2010, 310 hospitalizations of 152 patients with AML and 229 hospitalizations of 223 patients undergoing aSCT were eligible for analysis. Incidence rates for CDI per 10,000 patient days were 17.9 for AML patients and 27.4 for aSCT recipients. Among AML and aSCT patients, median time from initiation of chemotherapy to CDI was 10 days (range, -8 to 101 days) and 17 days (range, 6 to 79), respectively. Logistic regression identified carbapenem exposure to be associated with development of CDI in AML patients (odds ratio [OR], 2.2) and aSCT recipients (OR, 1.4). In both groups, previous exposure to carbapenems was significantly associated with development of CDI.

This translocation results in the inappropriate expression of TLX1 in T cells. The oncogenic potential of TLX1 was demonstrated in IgHμ-TLX1(Tg) mice which develop mature B cell lymphoma after a long latency period, suggesting the requirement of additional mutations to initiate malignancy. To determine whether dysregulation of genes involved in the DNA damage response contributed to tumor progression, we crossed IgHμ-TLX1(Tg) mice with mice deficient in the DNA repair enzyme DNA-PK (Prkdc(Scid/Scid) mice). IgHµ-TLX1(Tg)Prkdc(Scid/Scid) mice developed T-ALL and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with reduced latency relative to control Prkdc(Scid/Scid) mice. Further analysis of thymi from premalignant mice revealed greater thymic cellularity concomitant with increased thymocyte proliferation and decreased apoptotic index. Moreover, premalignant and malignant thymocytes exhibited impaired spindle checkpoint function, in association with aneuploid karyotypes. Gene expression profiling of premalignant IgHµ-TLX1(Tg)Prkdc(Scid/Scid) thymocytes revealed dysregulated expression of cell cycle, apoptotic and mitotic spindle checkpoint genes in double negative 2 (DN2) and DN3 stage thymocytes.

Mutations in the PHF6 gene have also been associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Approximately half of the disease-associated mutations are distributed in the second conserved extended plant homeodomain (ePHD2) of PHF6, indicating the functional importance of the ePHD2 domain. Here, we report the high resolution crystal structure of the ePHD2 domain of PHF6, which contains an N-terminal pre-PHD (C2HC zinc finger), a long linker, and an atypical PHD finger. PHF6-ePHD2 appears to fold as a novel integrated structural module. Structural analysis of PHF6-ePHD2 reveals pathological implication of PHF6 gene mutations in Börjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia. The binding experiments show that PHF6-ePHD2 can bind dsDNA but not histones. We also demonstrate PHF6 protein directly interacts with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex component RBBP4. Via this interaction, PHF6 exerts its transcriptional repression activity. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that PHF6 may function as a transcriptional repressor using its ePHD domains binding to the promoter region of its repressed gene, and this process was regulated by the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylation complex that was recruited to the genomic target site by NoLS region of PHF6.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Carrier Proteins, Crystallography, X-Ray, DNA, Epilepsy, Face, Fingers, Growth Disorders, Humans, Hypogonadism, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, X-Linked Intellectual Disability, Mutation, Obesity, Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma, Protein Folding, Protein Structure, Tertiary, Repressor Proteins, Structure-Activity Relationship","ListElement([StringElement('BFLS', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Extended PHD', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Genetic Diseases', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('NuRD', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('PHF6', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Protein Folding', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Protein-DNA Interaction', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('RBBP4', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Transcription Regulation', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'}), StringElement('Tumor Suppressor Gene', attributes={'MajorTopicYN': 'N'})], attributes={'Owner': 'NOTNLM'})","ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'PDB', 'AccessionNumberList': ['4NN2']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",PDB,4NN2

Here we show that an activating mutation of β-catenin in mouse osteoblasts alters the differentiation potential of myeloid and lymphoid progenitors leading to development of acute myeloid leukaemia with common chromosomal aberrations and cell autonomous progression. Activated β-catenin stimulates expression of the Notch ligand jagged 1 in osteoblasts. Subsequent activation of Notch signalling in haematopoietic stem cell progenitors induces the malignant changes. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Notch signalling ameliorates acute myeloid leukaemia and demonstrates the pathogenic role of the Notch pathway.

Its pathogenesis remains unclear, but mutations in epigenetic modifiers are common and the disease often responds to DNA methylation inhibitors. We analyzed DNA methylation in the bone marrow and spleen in two mouse models of MDS/AML, the NUP98-HOXD13 (NHD13) mouse and the RUNX1 mutant mouse model. Methylation array analysis showed an average of 512/3445 (14.9%) genes hypermethylated in NHD13 MDS, and 331 (9.6%) genes hypermethylated in RUNX1 MDS. Thirty-two percent of genes in common between the two models (2/3 NHD13 mice and 2/3 RUNX1 mice) were also hypermethylated in at least two of 19 human MDS samples. Detailed analysis of 41 genes in mice showed progressive drift in DNA methylation from young to old normal bone marrow and spleen; to MDS, where we detected accelerated age-related methylation; and finally to AML, which markedly extends DNA methylation abnormalities. Most of these genes showed similar patterns in human MDS and AML. Repeat element hypomethylation was rare in MDS but marked the transition to AML in some cases. Our data show consistency in patterns of aberrant DNA methylation in human and mouse MDS and suggest that epigenetically, MDS displays an accelerated aging phenotype.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Bone Marrow Cells, Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit, DNA Methylation, Disease Models, Animal, Epigenesis, Genetic, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE46067']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE46067

APL is the only malignancy definitively cured by targeted therapies: retinoic acid (RA) and/or arsenic trioxide, which both trigger PML-RARA degradation through nonoverlapping pathways. Yet, the cellular and molecular determinants of treatment efficacy remain disputed. We demonstrate that a functional Pml-transformation-related protein 53 (Trp53) axis is required to eradicate leukemia-initiating cells in a mouse model of APL. Upon RA-induced PML-RARA degradation, normal Pml elicits NB reformation and induces a Trp53 response exhibiting features of senescence but not apoptosis, ultimately abrogating APL-initiating activity. Apart from triggering PML-RARA degradation, arsenic trioxide also targets normal PML to enhance NB reformation, which may explain its clinical potency, alone or with RA. This Pml-Trp53 checkpoint initiated by therapy-triggered NB restoration is specific for PML-RARA-driven APL, but not the RA-resistant promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF)-RARA variant.

The identification of common mechanisms underlying LIC development will be important in establishing broadly effective therapeutics for AML. Constitutive NF-κB pathway activation has been reported in different types of AML; however, the mechanism of NF-κB activation and its importance in leukemia progression are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed myeloid leukemia mouse models to assess NF-κB activity in AML LICs. We found that LICs, but not normal hematopoietic stem cells or non-LIC fractions within leukemia cells, exhibited constitutive NF-κB activity. This activity was maintained through autocrine TNF-α secretion, which formed an NF-κB/TNF-α positive feedback loop. LICs had increased levels of active proteasome machinery, which promoted the degradation of IκBα and further supported NF-κB activity. Pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome complex markedly suppressed leukemia progression in vivo. Conversely, enhanced activation of NF-κB signaling expanded LIC frequency within leukemia cell populations. We also demonstrated a strong correlation between NF-κB activity and TNF-α secretion in human AML samples.

However, the molecular mechanism related to a favorable prognosis in AML1-ETO-positive AML is still not fully understood. Our results show that the AML1-ETO fusion protein triggered activation of early growth response gene l (EGR1) by binding at AML1-binding sites on the EGR1 promoter and, subsequently, recruiting acetyltransferase P300, which is known to acetylate histones. However, AML1-ETO could not recruit DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases; therefore, EGR1 expression was affected by histone acetylation but not by DNA methylation. Both transcription and translation of EGR1 were higher in AML1-ETO-positive AML cell lines than in AML1-ETO-negative AML cell lines, owing to acetylation. Furthermore, when AML1-ETO-positive AML cell lines were treated with C646 (P300 inhibitor) and trichostatin A (histone deacetylase inhibitor), EGR1 expression was significantly decreased and increased, respectively. In addition, treatment with 5-azacytidine (methyltransferase inhibitor) did not cause any significant change in EGR1 expression. Overexpression of EGR1 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis, and EGR1 knockout promoted cell proliferation. Thus, EGR1 could be a novel prognostic factor for a favorable outcome in AML1-ETO-positive AML.

This has made FLT3-activating mutations an attractive drug target because they are probable driver mutations of this disease. As more potent FLT3 inhibitors are developed, a predictable development of resistance-conferring point mutations, commonly at residue D835, has been observed. Crenolanib is a highly selective and potent FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with activity against the internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) mutants and the FLT3/D835 point mutants. We tested crenolanib against a panel of D835 mutant cell lines and primary patient blasts and observed superior cytotoxic effects when compared with other available FLT3 TKIs such as quizartinib and sorafenib. Another potential advantage of crenolanib is its reduced inhibition of c-Kit compared with quizartinib. In progenitor cell assays, crenolanib was less disruptive of erythroid colony growth, which may result in relatively less myelosuppression than quizartinib. Finally, correlative data from an ongoing clinical trial demonstrate that acute myeloid leukemia patients can achieve sufficient levels of crenolanib to inhibit both FLT3/ITD and resistance-conferring FLT3/D835 mutants in vivo.

It is a potent inhibitor of the FMS-like kinase 3 (FLT3) but shows in vitro activity in a wide range of AML samples. In the present study, we have characterized the effects of AKN-028 on AML cells in more detail. AKN-028 induced a dose-dependent G0/1 arrest in AML cell line MV4-11. Treatment with AKN-028 caused significantly altered gene expression in all AML cell types tested (430 downregulated, 280 upregulated transcripts). Subsequent gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of genes associated with the proto-oncogene and cell cycle regulator c-Myc among the downregulated genes in both AKN-028 and midostaurin treated cells. Kinase activity profiling in AML cell lines and primary AML samples showed that tyrosine kinase activity, but not serine/threonine kinase activity, was inhibited by AKN-028 in a dose dependent manner in all samples tested, reaching approximately the same level of kinase activity.

RUNX1 knockdown in Kasumi-1 cells (Kasumi-1(RX1-KD)) attenuates the cell-cycle mitotic checkpoint, leading to apoptosis, whereas knockdown of A-E in Kasumi-1(RX1-KD) rescues these cells. Mechanistically, a delicate RUNX1/A-E balance involving competition for common genomic sites that regulate RUNX1/A-E targets sustains the malignant cell phenotype. The broad medical significance of this leukemic cell addiction to native RUNX1 is underscored by clinical data showing that an active RUNX1 allele is usually preserved in both t(8;21) or inv(16) AML patients, whereas RUNX1 is frequently inactivated in other forms of leukemia.

In the present study, we examined the action of tipifarnib in human acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines and clinical samples. In contrast to the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway-mediated Bim upregulation that is responsible for tipifarnib-induced killing of malignant lymphoid cells, inhibition of Rheb-induced mTOR signaling followed by dose-dependent upregulation of Bax and Puma occurred in acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines undergoing tipifarnib-induced apoptosis. Similar Bax and Puma upregulation occurred in serial bone marrow samples harvested from a subset of acute myelogenous leukemia patients during tipifarnib treatment. Expression of FTI-resistant Rheb M184L, like knockdown of Bax or Puma, diminished tipifarnib-induced killing. Further analysis demonstrated that increased Bax and Puma levels reflect protein stabilization rather than increased gene expression. In U937 cells selected for tipifarnib resistance, neither inhibition of signaling downstream of Rheb nor Bax and Puma stabilization occurred. Collectively, these results not only identify a pathway downstream from Rheb that contributes to tipifarnib cytotoxicity in human acute myelogenous leukemia cells, but also demonstrate that FTI-induced killing of lymphoid versus myeloid cells reflects distinct biochemical mechanisms downstream of different farnesylated substrates.

However, no somatic RUNX1 alteration was found in AMLs with leukemogenic fusion proteins, such as core-binding factor (CBF) leukemia and MLL fusion leukemia, raising the possibility that RUNX1 could actually promote the growth of these leukemia cells. Using normal human cord blood cells and those expressing leukemogenic fusion proteins, we discovered a dual role of RUNX1 in myeloid leukemogenesis. RUNX1 overexpression inhibited the growth of normal cord blood cells by inducing myeloid differentiation, whereas a certain level of RUNX1 activity was required for the growth of AML1-ETO and MLL-AF9 cells. Using a mouse genetic model, we also showed that the combined loss of Runx1/Cbfb inhibited leukemia development induced by MLL-AF9. RUNX2 could compensate for the loss of RUNX1.

AML1-ETO, a fusion protein generated by the t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid leukaemia, is a transcription factor implicated in both gene repression and activation. AML1-ETO oligomerization, mediated by the NHR2 domain, is critical for leukaemogenesis, making it important to identify co-regulatory factors that 'read' the NHR2 oligomerization and contribute to leukaemogenesis. Here we show that, in human leukaemic cells, AML1-ETO resides in and functions through a stable AML1-ETO-containing transcription factor complex (AETFC) that contains several haematopoietic transcription (co)factors. These AETFC components stabilize the complex through multivalent interactions, provide multiple DNA-binding domains for diverse target genes, co-localize genome wide, cooperatively regulate gene expression, and contribute to leukaemogenesis. Within the AETFC complex, AML1-ETO oligomerization is required for a specific interaction between the oligomerized NHR2 domain and a novel NHR2-binding (N2B) motif in E proteins. Crystallographic analysis of the NHR2-N2B complex reveals a unique interaction pattern in which an N2B peptide makes direct contact with side chains of two NHR2 domains as a dimer, providing a novel model of how dimeric/oligomeric transcription factors create a new protein-binding interface through dimerization/oligomerization. Intriguingly, disruption of this interaction by point mutations abrogates AML1-ETO-induced haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell self-renewal and leukaemogenesis. These results reveal new mechanisms of action of AML1-ETO, and provide a potential therapeutic target in t(8;21)-positive acute myeloid leukaemia.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Amino Acid Motifs, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Binding Sites, Cell Division, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit, Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Multiprotein Complexes, Oncogene Proteins, Fusion, Point Mutation, Protein Binding, Protein Multimerization, Protein Stability, Protein Structure, Tertiary, RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein, Transcription Factors",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE43834']}, {'DataBankName': 'PDB', 'AccessionNumberList': ['4JOL']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE43834

In the present study, through a large-scale, genomewide miRNA expression assay, we show that microRNA-9 (miR-9) is the most specifically up-regulated miRNA in MLL-rearranged AML compared with both normal control and non-MLL-rearranged AML. We demonstrate that miR-9 is a direct target of MLL fusion proteins and can be significantly up-regulated in expression by the latter in human and mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Depletion of endogenous miR-9 expression by an appropriate antagomiR can significantly inhibit cell growth/viability and promote apoptosis in human MLL-rearranged AML cells, and the opposite is true when expression of miR-9 is forced. Blocking endogenous miR-9 function by anti-miRNA sponge can significantly inhibit, whereas forced expression of miR-9 can significantly promote, MLL fusion-induced immortalization/transformation of normal mouse bone marrow progenitor cells in vitro. Furthermore, forced expression of miR-9 can significantly promote MLL fusion-mediated leukemogenesis in vivo. In addition, a group of putative target genes of miR-9 exhibited a significant inverse correlation of expression with miR-9 in a series of leukemia sample sets, suggesting that they are potential targets of miR-9 in MLL-rearranged AML.

Often, the focus of therapy is centered on achieving complete remission of disease in order to proceed with a consolidative stem cell transplant. At issue with this paradigm is the multitude of patients who are unable to achieve complete remission with standard chemotherapeutic options. A major benefit of transplantation is the graft versus tumor effect that follows successful engraftment. However, with this graft versus tumor effect comes the risk of graft versus host disease.

To define the molecular etiology of this disease, we have developed murine models of this disease, in syngeneic hosts as well as in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency/interleukin 2Rγ(null) mice engrafted with transformed human CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Both murine models mimic the human disease with splenohepatomegaly, hypercellular bone marrow, and myeloproliferative neoplasms that progresses to acute myeloid leukemia. Molecular genetic analyses of these model mice, as well as primary human disease, demonstrated that CNTRL-FGFR1, through abnormal activation of several signaling pathways related to development and differentiation of both myeloid and T-lymphoid cells, contribute to overt leukemogenesis. Clonal evolution analysis indicates that myeloid related neoplasms arise from common myeloid precursor cells that retain potential for T-lymphoid differentiation.

We explored this issue in a mouse knockin model of gain-of-function Flt3-ITD mutation because FLT3-ITDs are paradoxically restricted to acute myeloid leukemia even though Flt3 primarily promotes lymphoid development during normal hematopoiesis. When expressed in MPPs, Flt3-ITD collaborated with Runx1 mutation to induce high-penetrance aggressive leukemias that were exclusively of the myeloid phenotype. Flt3-ITDs preferentially expanded MPPs with reduced lymphoid and increased myeloid transcriptional priming while compromising early B and T lymphopoiesis. Flt3-ITD-induced myeloid lineage bias involved upregulation of the transcription factor Pu.1, which is a direct target gene of Stat3, an aberrantly activated target of Flt3-ITDs, further establishing how lineage bias can be inflicted on MPPs through aberrant GFR signaling.

We show that anthracyclines promote histone eviction irrespective of their ability to induce DNA double-strand breaks. The histone variant H2AX, which is a key component of the DNA damage response, is also evicted by anthracyclines, and H2AX eviction is associated with attenuated DNA repair. Histone eviction deregulates the transcriptome in cancer cells and organs such as the heart, and can drive apoptosis of topoisomerase-negative acute myeloid leukaemia blasts in patients.

Our new technique, immuno-TRAP, overcomes these limitations. Using promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs) as a model, we used immuno-TRAP to determine if specific genes localize within molecular dimensions with these bodies. Although we confirmed a TP53 gene-PML NB association, immuno-TRAP allowed us to uncover novel locus-PML NB associations, including the ABCA7 and TFF1 loci and, most surprisingly, the PML locus itself.

However, relatively few agents have been shown to target LSCs, slowing progress in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Based on in vitro and in vivo evidence, we report here that fenretinide, a well-tolerated vitamin A derivative, is capable of eradicating LSCs but not normal hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells at physiologically achievable concentrations. Fenretinide exerted a selective cytotoxic effect on primary AML CD34(+) cells, especially the LSC-enriched CD34(+)CD38(-) subpopulation, whereas no significant effect was observed on normal counterparts. Methylcellulose colony formation assays further showed that fenretinide significantly suppressed the formation of colonies derived from AML CD34(+) cells but not those from normal CD34(+) cells. Moreover, fenretinide significantly reduced the in vivo engraftment of AML stem cells but not normal hematopoietic stem cells in a nonobese diabetic/SCID mouse xenotransplantation model. Mechanistic studies revealed that fenretinide-induced cell death was linked to a series of characteristic events, including the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species, induction of genes associated with stress responses and apoptosis, and repression of genes involved in NF-κB and Wnt signaling. Further bioinformatic analysis revealed that the fenretinide-down-regulated genes were significantly correlated with the existing poor-prognosis signatures in AML patients. Based on these findings, we propose that fenretinide is a potent agent that selectively targets LSCs, and may be of value in the treatment of AML.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Antigens, CD34, Colony-Forming Units Assay, Computational Biology, Fenretinide, Flow Cytometry, Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Mice, SCID, Microarray Analysis, Neoplastic Stem Cells, Reactive Oxygen Species, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE33243']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE33243

Double mutations in CEBPA can be detected using various techniques, but it is a notoriously difficult gene to sequence due to its high GC-content. Here we developed a two-step gene expression classifier for accurate and standardized detection of CEBPA double mutations. The key feature of the two-step classifier is that it explicitly removes cases with low CEBPA expression, thereby excluding CEBPA hypermethylated cases that have similar gene expression profiles as a CEBPA double mutant, which would result in false-positive predictions. In the second step, we have developed a 55 gene signature to identity the true CEBPA double-mutation cases. This two-step classifier was tested on a cohort of 505 unselected AML cases, including 26 CEBPA double mutants, 12 CEBPA single mutants, and seven CEBPA promoter hypermethylated cases, on which its performance was estimated by a double-loop cross-validation protocol. The two-step classifier achieves a sensitivity of 96.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 81.1 to 99.3) and specificity of 100.0% (95% CI 99.2 to 100.0). There are no false-positive detections. This two-step CEBPA double-mutation classifier has been incorporated on a microarray platform that can simultaneously detect other relevant molecular biomarkers, which allows for a standardized comprehensive diagnostic assay.

As aberrant transcriptional regulators, MLL-fusion proteins alter gene expression in hematopoietic cells through interactions with the histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase DOT1L. Notably, interference with MLL-fusion cofactors like DOT1L is an emerging therapeutic strategy in this disease. Here, we identify the histone H2B E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 20 (RNF20) as an additional chromatin regulator that is necessary for MLL-fusion-mediated leukemogenesis. Suppressing the expression of Rnf20 in diverse models of MLL-rearranged leukemia leads to inhibition of cell proliferation, under tissue culture conditions as well as in vivo. Rnf20 knockdown leads to reduced expression of MLL-fusion target genes, effects resembling Dot1l inhibition. Using ChIP-seq, we found that H2B ubiquitination is enriched in the body of MLL-fusion target genes, correlating with sites of H3K79 methylation and transcription elongation. Furthermore, Rnf20 is required to maintain local levels of H3K79 methylation by Dot1l at Hoxa9 and Meis1. These findings support a model whereby cotranscriptional recruitment of Rnf20 at MLL-fusion target genes leads to amplification of Dot1l-mediated H3K79 methylation, thereby rendering leukemia cells dependent on Rnf20 to maintain their oncogenic transcriptional program.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Base Sequence, Cell Line, Tumor, DNA, Neoplasm, Gene Knockdown Techniques, Gene Rearrangement, Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase, Histones, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Models, Biological, Molecular Sequence Data, Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein, Oncogene Proteins, Fusion, Proto-Oncogenes, RNA, Small Interfering, Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE43725']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE43725

However, human cytomegalovirus can manipulate this central innate interaction through the provision of a ""mimic"" of the HLA-encoded peptide derived from the immunomodulatory glycoprotein UL40. Here, we analyzed UL40 sequences isolated from 32 hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients experiencing cytomegalovirus reactivation. The UL40 protein showed a ""polymorphic hot spot"" within the region that encodes the HLA leader sequence mimic. Although all sequences that were identical to those encoded within HLA-I genes permitted the interaction between HLA-E and CD94-NKG2 receptors, other UL40 polymorphisms reduced the affinity of the interaction between HLA-E and CD94-NKG2 receptors. Furthermore, functional studies using NK cell clones expressing either the inhibitory receptor CD94-NKG2A or the activating receptor CD94-NKG2C identified UL40-encoded peptides that were capable of inhibiting target cell lysis via interaction with CD94-NKG2A, yet had little capacity to activate NK cells through CD94-NKG2C.

Thirty-seven patients received oral selenium tablets (200 mcg twice daily) from the starting day of HDC to 14 days after transplantation. OM was evaluated daily for 21 days after transplantation according to World Health Organization oral toxicity scale. The incidence of severe OM (grades 3-4) was significantly lower in the selenium group (10.8% vs 35.1%, P<0.05).

AMLs bearing MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) rearrangements are associated with intermediate or poor survival. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding RNAs, have been postulated to be important gene expression regulators virtually in all biological processes, including leukemogenesis. Through a large-scale, genome-wide miRNA expression profiling assay of 85 human AML and 15 normal control samples, we show that among 48 miRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed between MLL- and non-MLL-rearranged AML samples, only one (miR-495) is expressed at a lower level in MLL-rearranged AML than in non-MLL-rearranged AML; meanwhile, miR-495 is also significantly down-regulated in MLL-rearranged AML samples compared with normal control samples. Through in vitro colony-forming/replating assays and in vivo bone marrow transplantation studies, we show that forced expression of miR-495 significantly inhibits MLL-fusion-mediated cell transformation in vitro and leukemogenesis in vivo. In human leukemic cells carrying MLL rearrangements, ectopic expression of miR-495 greatly inhibits cell viability and increases cell apoptosis. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that PBX3 and MEIS1 are two direct target genes of miR-495, and forced expression of either of them can reverse the effects of miR-495 overexpression on inhibiting cell viability and promoting apoptosis of human MLL-rearranged leukemic cells. Thus, our data indicate that miR-495 likely functions as a tumor suppressor in AML with MLL rearrangements by targeting essential leukemia-related genes.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Base Sequence, Case-Control Studies, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Down-Regulation, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic, Gene Rearrangement, Genes, Neoplasm, Genetic Association Studies, Homeodomain Proteins, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, MicroRNAs, Molecular Sequence Data, Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein, Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein, Neoplasm Proteins, Oncogene Proteins, Fusion, Proto-Oncogene Proteins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE30258', 'GSE34185']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE30258

Similarly, > 30% differences were observed at only 59 sites when we comparing the cord and adult blood. These conserved methylation patterns contrasted with extensive changes affecting 18-40% of CpG sites in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia and in two leukemia cell lines. The method is cost effective, quantitative (r ( 2) = 0.93 when compared with bisulfite pyrosequencing) and reproducible (r ( 2) = 0.997). Using 100-fold coverage, DREAM can detect differences in methylation greater than 10% or 30% with a false positive rate below 0.05 or 0.001, respectively. DREAM can be useful in quantifying epigenetic effects of environment and nutrition, correlating developmental epigenetic variation with phenotypes, understanding epigenetics of cancer and chronic diseases, measuring the effects of drugs on DNA methylation or deriving new biological insights into mammalian genomes.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Base Sequence, Cell Line, Tumor, Chromosomes, Human, X, Conserved Sequence, CpG Islands, DNA Methylation, Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific, Female, Genomic Imprinting, Humans, Leukemia, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Leukocytes, Male, Reference Values, Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid, Sequence Analysis, DNA",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE39787']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE39787

HCLS1 binds the transcription factor lymphoid-enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF-1), transporting LEF-1 into the nucleus upon G-CSF stimulation and inducing LEF-1 autoregulation. In patients with severe congenital neutropenia, inherited mutations in the gene encoding HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX1) lead to profound defects in G-CSF-triggered phosphorylation of HCLS1 and subsequently to reduced autoregulation and expression of LEF-1. Consistent with these results, HCLS1-deficient mice are neutropenic. In bone marrow biopsies of the majority of tested patients with acute myeloid leukemia, HCLS1 protein expression is substantially elevated, associated with high levels of G-CSF synthesis and, in some individuals, a four-residue insertion in a proline-rich region of HCLS1 protein known to accelerate intracellular signaling.

However, the potential benefit of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) according to the NPM1/FLT3-ITD status has been poorly studied in AML patients with a normal karyotype (NK). Therefore, we evaluated the NPM1/FLT3-ITD molecular status in 135 NK-AML patients treated by allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT), auto-HSCT, or chemotherapy as consolidation therapy within the GOELAMS LAM-2001 trial. In univariate analyzes, 4-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly higher for NPM1+/FLT3-ITD- patients compared with patients presenting another molecular profile (61 vs. 43% and 72 vs. 48%, P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively). In the NPM1+/FLT3-ITD- subgroup, there was no benefit for allo-HSCT or auto-HSCT vs. chemotherapy (4-year LFS: 71, 56, and 60%; 4-year OS: 73, 71, and 60%, respectively; P = NS). For patients with other NPM1/FLT3-ITD molecular profiles, allo-HSCT was found to be the best consolidation therapy, whereas auto-HSCT was associated with a better outcome when compared with chemotherapy (allo-HSCT-, auto-HSCT-, and chemotherapy-related 4-year LFS: 68, 44, and 36%, P = 0.004; 4-year OS: 68, 52, and 29%, respectively, P = 0.02).

Lintuzumab (SGN-33; HuM195) is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD33, which is expressed on the majority of myeloblasts in acute myeloid leukemia. The primary objective of this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was to determine whether addition of lintuzumab to low-dose cytarabine would increase overall survival in adults aged 60 years and over with untreated acute myeloid leukemia. Randomization was stratified by age, previous hematologic disorder, and performance status. All patients received cytarabine (20 mg subcutaneously twice daily) on Days 1-10 of each 28-day cycle. Patients received lintuzumab (600 mg) or placebo intravenously once weekly in Cycle 1 and once every other week in Cycles 2-12. A total of 211 patients (107 lintuzumab, 104 placebo) were randomized. Median age was 70 years (range 60-90). Survival was not significantly prolonged with lintuzumab treatment (hazard ratio 0.96; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-1.28; P=0.7585).

It remains unclear how IDH1 and IDH2 mutations modify myeloid cell development and promote leukaemogenesis. Here we report the characterization of conditional knock-in (KI) mice in which the most common IDH1 mutation, IDH1(R132H), is inserted into the endogenous murine Idh1 locus and is expressed in all haematopoietic cells (Vav-KI mice) or specifically in cells of the myeloid lineage (LysM-KI mice). These mutants show increased numbers of early haematopoietic progenitors and develop splenomegaly and anaemia with extramedullary haematopoiesis, suggesting a dysfunctional bone marrow niche. Furthermore, LysM-KI cells have hypermethylated histones and changes to DNA methylation similar to those observed in human IDH1- or IDH2-mutant AML.

So far, it is not known whether other genetic alterations cooperate with biCEBPA mutations during leukemogenesis. To identify additional mutations, we performed whole exome sequencing of 5 biCEBPA patients and detected somatic GATA2 zinc finger 1 (ZF1) mutations in 2 of 5 cases. Both GATA2 and CEBPA are transcription factors crucial for hematopoietic development. Inherited or acquired mutations in both genes have been associated with leukemogenesis. Further mutational screening detected novel GATA2 ZF1 mutations in 13 of 33 biCEBPA-positive CN-AML patients (13/33, 39.4%). No GATA2 mutations were found in 38 CN-AML patients with a monoallelic CEBPA mutation and in 89 CN-AML patients with wild-type CEBPA status. The presence of additional GATA2 mutations (n=10) did not significantly influence the clinical outcome of 26 biCEBPA-positive patients. In reporter gene assays, all tested GATA2 ZF1 mutants showed reduced capacity to enhance CEBPA-mediated activation of transcription, suggesting that the GATA2 ZF1 mutations may collaborate with biCEPBA mutations to deregulate target genes during malignant transformation. We thus provide evidence for a genetically distinct subgroup of CN-AML.

Therefore identifying predictive factors for AZA resistance is of great interest to propose alternative therapeutic strategies for non-responsive patients. We generated AZA-resistant myeloid cell line (SKM1-R) that exhibited increased expression of BCL2L10 an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 member. Importantly, BCL2L10 knockdown sensitized SKM1-R cells to AZA effect suggesting that increased BCL2L10 expression is linked to AZA resistance in SKM1-R. We next established in 77 MDS patients that resistance to AZA is significantly correlated with the percentage of MDS or AML cells expressing BCL2L10. In addition, we showed that the proportion of BCL2L10 positive bone marrow cells can predict overall survival in MDS or AML patients. We propose a convenient assay in which the percentage of BCL2L10 expressing cells as assessed by flow cytometry is predictive of whether or not a patient will become resistant to AZA.

Thus, a phase 1 trial of bortezomib and decitabine was developed. Nineteen poor-risk AML patients (median age 70 years; range, 32-84 years) enrolled. Induction with decitabine (20 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1-10) plus bortezomib (escalated up to the target 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 5, 8, 12, and 15) was tolerable, but bortezomib-related neuropathy developed after repetitive cycles.

Pharmacodynamic analysis showed FLT3 down-regulation on day 26 of cycle 1 (P = .02). Additional mechanistic studies showed that FLT3 down-regulation was due to bortezomib-induced miR-29b up-regulation; this led to SP1 down-regulation and destruction of the SP1/NF-κB complex that transactivated FLT3.

However, among patients with non-APL AML, ATRA-based treatment has not been effective. Here we show that, through epigenetic reprogramming, inhibitors of lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1, also called KDM1A), including tranylcypromine (TCP), unlocked the ATRA-driven therapeutic response in non-APL AML. LSD1 inhibition did not lead to a large-scale increase in histone 3 Lys4 dimethylation (H3K4(me2)) across the genome, but it did increase H3K4(me2) and expression of myeloid-differentiation-associated genes. Notably, treatment with ATRA plus TCP markedly diminished the engraftment of primary human AML cells in vivo in nonobese diabetic (NOD)-severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, suggesting that ATRA in combination with TCP may target leukemia-initiating cells. Furthermore, initiation of ATRA plus TCP treatment 15 d after engraftment of human AML cells in NOD-SCID γ (with interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor γ chain deficiency) mice also revealed the ATRA plus TCP drug combination to have a potent anti-leukemic effect that was superior to treatment with either drug alone. These data identify LSD1 as a therapeutic target and strongly suggest that it may contribute to AML pathogenesis by inhibiting the normal pro-differentiative function of ATRA, paving the way for new combinatorial therapies for AML.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Antigens, CD34, Apoptosis, CD11b Antigen, Cell Differentiation, Cells, Cultured, Cytokines, Disease Models, Animal, Drug Interactions, Enzyme Inhibitors, Female, Flow Cytometry, Gene Expression Regulation, Histone Demethylases, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Lysine, Mice, Mice, Inbred NOD, Mice, SCID, RNA, Small Interfering, Stem Cell Factor, Time Factors, Transplants, Tranylcypromine, Tretinoin",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE34672', 'GSE34726']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE34672

CD33 expression varied more than 2-log fold; a median mean fluorescent intensity of 129 (range, 3-1550.07) was observed. Patients were divided into 4 quartiles, quartiles 1-4 (Q1-4) based on expression and disease characteristics and clinical response defined across quartiles. High CD33 expression was associated with high-risk FLT3/ITD mutations (P < .001) and was inversely associated with low-risk disease (P < .001). Complete remission (CR) rates were similar, but patients in Q4 had significantly lower overall survival (57% ± 16% vs 77% ± 7%, P = .002) and disease-free survival from CR (44% ± 16% vs 62% ± 8%, P = .022). In a multivariate model, high CD33 expression remained a significant predictor of overall survival (P = .011) and disease-free survival (P = .038) from CR.

The genetic alteration in this critical regulatory sequence resulted in reduced reporter gene activity and absent binding of transcription factor NF-Y, likely responsible for reduced TERC levels, decreased telomerase activity, and short telomeres.

However, pharmacologic inhibition of MYC function has proven challenging because of both the diverse mechanisms driving its aberrant expression and the challenge of disrupting protein-DNA interactions. Here, we demonstrate the rapid and potent abrogation of MYC gene transcription by representative small molecule inhibitors of the BET family of chromatin adaptors. MYC transcriptional suppression was observed in the context of the natural, chromosomally translocated, and amplified gene locus. Inhibition of BET bromodomain-promoter interactions and subsequent reduction of MYC transcript and protein levels resulted in G(1) arrest and extensive apoptosis in a variety of leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. Exogenous expression of MYC from an artificial promoter that is resistant to BET regulation significantly protected cells from cell cycle arrest and growth suppression by BET inhibitors. MYC suppression was accompanied by deregulation of the MYC transcriptome, including potent reactivation of the p21 tumor suppressor. Treatment with a BET inhibitor resulted in significant antitumor activity in xenograft models of Burkitt's lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia.

Diagnostic marrow specimens from 527 AML patients treated on the pediatric trial Children's Oncology Group-AAML03P1 (N = 253) or adult SWOG trials (N = 274) were analyzed for the presence of the SNP. SNP rs11554137 was present in 11% of all patients. SNP status had no prognostic impact on survival in pediatric patients. In adult AML, overall survival for SNP-positive patients was 10% versus 18% for SNP-negative patients (P = .44). Among the 142 adults who achieved complete remission, 5-year relapse-free survival was significantly worse for SNP-positive patients (0% vs 25%, P = .0014). However, among adults with normal cytogenetics, FLT3/ITD was present in 90% of SNP-positive patients versus 59% of SNP-negative patients (P = .0053). In multivariate analysis, adjusting for the effects of age, cytogenetics, and FLT3/ITD, the independent prognostic effect of SNP positivity was not statistically significant (hazard ratio = 1.72, P = .18).

Cancer cells are characterized by altered epigenetic landscapes, and commonly exploit the chromatin regulatory machinery to enforce oncogenic gene expression programs. Although chromatin alterations are, in principle, reversible and often amenable to drug intervention, the promise of targeting such pathways therapeutically has been limited by an incomplete understanding of cancer-specific dependencies on epigenetic regulators. Here we describe a non-biased approach to probe epigenetic vulnerabilities in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), an aggressive haematopoietic malignancy that is often associated with aberrant chromatin states. By screening a custom library of small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting known chromatin regulators in a genetically defined AML mouse model, we identify the protein bromodomain-containing 4 (Brd4) as being critically required for disease maintenance. Suppression of Brd4 using shRNAs or the small-molecule inhibitor JQ1 led to robust antileukaemic effects in vitro and in vivo, accompanied by terminal myeloid differentiation and elimination of leukaemia stem cells. Similar sensitivities were observed in a variety of human AML cell lines and primary patient samples, revealing that JQ1 has broad activity in diverse AML subtypes. The effects of Brd4 suppression are, at least in part, due to its role in sustaining Myc expression to promote aberrant self-renewal, which implicates JQ1 as a pharmacological means to suppress MYC in cancer. Our results establish small-molecule inhibition of Brd4 as a promising therapeutic strategy in AML and, potentially, other cancers, and highlight the utility of RNA interference (RNAi) screening for revealing epigenetic vulnerabilities that can be exploited for direct pharmacological intervention.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Acetylation, Animals, Azepines, Cell Differentiation, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Chromatin, Disease Progression, Epigenesis, Genetic, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genes, myc, Histones, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Neoplasm Transplantation, Neoplastic Stem Cells, Nuclear Proteins, RNA Interference, RNA, Small Interfering, Transcription Factors, Triazoles",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE29799']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE29799

Detailed bone marrow analyses performed on 18 patients further define this disorder. The majority of patients had hypocellular marrows with reticulin fibrosis and multilineage dysplasia affecting the myeloid (72%), erythroid (83%) and megakaryocytic (100%) lineages.

Patients discharged early spent a median of 8 days (range 3-36 days), or 54% of their study time, as outpatients. These patients required less time on intravenous antibiotics (6 vs. 16 days; P=0.11), received fewer red blood cell transfusions (0.25 vs. 0.48 units/day; P=0.08), and incurred lower median daily charges ($3,270 vs. $5,467; P=0.01) than controls.

Between 1996 and 2009, 651 APL patients with available data on CD56 expression were included in 3 subsequent trials (PETHEMA LPA96 and LPA99 and PETHEMA/HOVON LPA2005). Seventy-two patients (11%) were CD56(+) (expression of CD56 in ≥ 20% leukemic promyelocytes). CD56(+) APL was significantly associated with high white blood cell counts; low albumin levels; BCR3 isoform; and the coexpression of CD2, CD34, CD7, HLA-DR, CD15, and CD117 antigens. For CD56(+) APL, the 5-year relapse rate was 22%, compared with a 10% relapse rate for CD56(-) APL (P = .006). In the multivariate analysis, CD56 expression retained the statistical significance together with the relapse-risk score. CD56(+) APL also showed a greater risk of extramedullary relapse (P < .001). In summary, CD56 expression is associated with the coexpression of immaturity-associated and T-cell antigens and is an independent adverse prognostic factor for relapse in patients with APL treated with all-trans-retinoic acid plus idarubicin-derived regimens.

The gene encoding TET2 resides at chromosome 4q24, in a region showing recurrent microdeletions and copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) in patients with diverse myeloid malignancies. Somatic TET2 mutations are frequently observed in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), MDS/MPN overlap syndromes including chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML), acute myeloid leukaemias (AML) and secondary AML (sAML). We show here that TET2 mutations associated with myeloid malignancies compromise catalytic activity. Bone marrow samples from patients with TET2 mutations displayed uniformly low levels of 5hmC in genomic DNA compared to bone marrow samples from healthy controls. Moreover, small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of Tet2 in mouse haematopoietic precursors skewed their differentiation towards monocyte/macrophage lineages in culture. There was no significant difference in DNA methylation between bone marrow samples from patients with high 5hmC versus healthy controls, but samples from patients with low 5hmC showed hypomethylation relative to controls at the majority of differentially methylated CpG sites. Our results demonstrate that Tet2 is important for normal myelopoiesis, and suggest that disruption of TET2 enzymatic activity favours myeloid tumorigenesis. Measurement of 5hmC levels in myeloid malignancies may prove valuable as a diagnostic and prognostic tool, to tailor therapies and assess responses to anticancer drugs.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","5-Methylcytosine, Animals, Biocatalysis, Cell Differentiation, Cell Line, CpG Islands, DNA Methylation, DNA, Neoplasm, DNA-Binding Proteins, Dioxygenases, Humans, Hydroxylation, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Mutant Proteins, Mutation, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Proto-Oncogene Proteins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE25706']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE25706

We studied effect of VEGFC on treatment outcome and investigated gene expression profiles associated with VEGFC using microarray data of 525 adult and 100 pediatric patients with AML. High VEGFC expression appeared strongly associated with reduced complete remission rate (P = .004), reduced overall and event-free survival (OS and EFS) in adult AML (P = .002 and P < .001, respectively). Multivariable analysis established high VEGFC as prognostic indicator independent of cytogenetic risk, FLT3-ITD, NPM1, CEBPA, age, and white blood cell count (P = .038 for OS; P = .006 for EFS). Also, in pediatric AML high VEGFC was related to reduced OS (P = .041). A unique series of differentially expressed genes was identified that distinguished AML with high VEGFC from AML with low VEGFC, that is, 331 up-regulated genes (representative of proliferation, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor activity, signal transduction) and 44 down-regulated genes (eg, related to apoptosis) consistent with a role in enhanced chemoresistance.

We designed a new trial (LPA2005) with the objective of achieving stepwise improvements in outcome. Between July 2005 and April 2009, low- and intermediate-risk patients (leukocytes < 10 x 10(9)/L) received a reduced dose of mitoxantrone for the second consolidation course, whereas high- risk patients younger than 60 years of age received cytarabine combined with ATRA and idarubicin in the first and third consolidation courses. Of 372 patients attaining complete remission after ATRA plus idarubicin (92.5%), 368 proceeded to consolidation therapy. For low- and intermediate-risk patients, duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and hospital stay were significantly reduced without sacrificing antileukemic efficacy, compared with the previous LPA99 trial. For high-risk patients, the 3-year relapse rate was significantly lower in the LPA2005 trial (11%) than in the LPA99 (26%; P = .03). Overall disease-free survival was also better in the LPA2005 trial (P = .04). In conclusion, the lower dose of mitoxantrone resulted in a significant reduction of toxicity and hospital stay while maintaining the antileukemic activity, and the combination of ATRA, idarubicin, and cytarabine for high-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia significantly reduced the relapse rate in this setting.

Because chemokines are implicated in migration and extravasation of leukemic cells, chemokines might play a role in DS. ATRA stimulation of the APL cell line NB4 induced expression of multiple CC-chemokines (CCLs) and their receptors (> 19-fold), resulting in increased chemokine levels and chemotaxis. Induction of CCL2 and CCL24 was directly mediated by ligand-activated retinoic acid receptors. In primary leukemia cells derived from APL patients at diagnosis, ATRA induced chemokine production as well. Furthermore, in plasma of an APL patient with DS, we observed chemokine induction, suggesting that chemokines might be important in DS. Dexamethasone, which efficiently reduces pulmonary chemokine production, did not inhibit chemokine induction in APL cells.

We propose that differentiation therapy may induce chemokine production in the lung and in APL cells, which both trigger migration of leukemic cells.

In this study, we examined the roles of GATA-1 and GATA-2 in activating transcription of the secretory ribonuclease, the eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN/RNase 2). Augmented expression of both GATA-1 and GATA-2 was detected in eosinophil promyelocyte HL-60 clone 15 cells in response to biochemical differentiation with butyric acid. Deletion or mutation of one or both of the two consensus GATA-binding sites in the extended 1000-bp 5' promoter of the EDN gene resulted in profound reduction in reporter gene activity. Antibody-augmented electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicate that GATA-1 and GATA-2 proteins bind to both functional GATA consensus sequences in the EDN promoter. Interestingly, RNA silencing of GATA-1 alone had no impact on EDN expression; silencing of GATA-2 resulted in diminished expression of EDN, and also diminished expression of GATA-1 in both butyric acid-induced HL-60 clone 15 cells and in differentiating human eosinophils derived from CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitors. Likewise, overexpression of GATA-2 in uninduced HL-60 clone 15 cells resulted in augmented transcription of both EDN and GATA-1. Taken together, our data suggest that GATA-2 functions directly via interactions with the EDN promoter and also indirectly, via its ability to regulate the expression of GATA-1 in differentiating eosinophils and eosinophil cell lines.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural","Blotting, Western, Cells, Cultured, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, Eosinophil-Derived Neurotoxin, Eosinophils, GATA1 Transcription Factor, GATA2 Transcription Factor, Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic, Humans, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Promoter Regions, Genetic, RNA, Messenger, RNA, Small Interfering, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Umbilical Cord",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['FJ785402']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052060'})]",GENBANK,FJ785402

DNA methylation studies revealed that these 2 groups of patients could be readily segregated in an unsupervised fashion based on their DNA methylation profiles alone. Furthermore, CEBPA silencing was associated with the presence of an aberrant DNA hypermethylation signature, which was not present in the CEBPA mutant group. This aberrant hypermethylation occurred more frequently at sites within CpG islands. CEBPA-silenced leukemias also displayed marked hypermethylation compared with normal CD34(+) hematopoietic cells, whereas CEBPA mutant cases showed only mild changes in DNA methylation compared with these normal progenitors.

An important role for Lyn has been reported in acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia, as well as certain solid tumors. Although several Src-family inhibitors are available, the development of Lyn-specific inhibitors, or inhibitors with reduced off-target activity to Lyn, has been hampered by the lack of structural data on the Lyn kinase. Here we report the crystal structure of the non-liganded form of Lyn kinase domain, as well as in complex with three different inhibitors: the ATP analogue AMP-PNP; the pan Src kinase inhibitor PP2; and the BCR-Abl/Src-family inhibitor Dasatinib. The Lyn kinase domain was determined in its ""active"" conformation, but in the unphosphorylated state. All three inhibitors are bound at the ATP-binding site, with PP2 and Dasatinib extending into a hydrophobic pocket deep in the substrate cleft, thereby providing a basis for the Src-specific inhibition.

PLZF represses the CRABPI locus through propagation of chromatin condensation from a remote intronic binding element culminating in silencing of the promoter. Although the canonical, PLZF-RARalpha oncoprotein has no impact on PLZF-mediated repression, the reciprocal translocation product RARalpha-PLZF binds to this remote binding site, recruiting p300, inducing promoter hypomethylation and CRABPI gene up-regulation. In line with these observations, RA-resistant murine PLZF/RARalpha+RARalpha/PLZF APL blasts express much higher levels of CRABPI than standard RA-sensitive PML/RARalpha APL. RARalpha-PLZF confers RA resistance to a retinoid-sensitive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line in a CRABPI-dependent fashion.

We examined the transcriptome of preleukemic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in which PU.1 was knocked down (referred to as 'PU.1-knockdown HSCs') to identify transcriptional changes preceding malignant transformation. Transcription factors c-Jun and JunB were among the top-downregulated targets. Restoration of c-Jun expression in preleukemic cells rescued the PU.1 knockdown-initiated myelomonocytic differentiation block. Lentiviral restoration of JunB at the leukemic stage led to loss of leukemic self-renewal capacity and prevented leukemia in NOD-SCID mice into which leukemic PU.1-knockdown cells were transplanted. Examination of human individuals with AML confirmed the correlation between PU.1 and JunB downregulation. These results delineate a transcriptional pattern that precedes leukemic transformation in PU.1-knockdown HSCs and demonstrate that decreased levels of c-Jun and JunB contribute to the development of PU.1 knockdown-induced AML by blocking differentiation and increasing self-renewal.

We predict CRMs for mammalian genes expressed in red blood cells by combining two properties gleaned from aligned, noncoding genome sequences: a positive regulatory potential (RP) score, which detects similarity to patterns in alignments distinctive for regulatory regions, and conservation of a binding site motif for the essential erythroid transcription factor GATA-1. Within eight target loci, we tested 75 noncoding segments by reporter gene assays in transiently transfected human K562 cells and/or after site-directed integration into murine erythroleukemia cells. Segments with a high RP score and a conserved exact match to the binding site consensus are validated at a good rate (50%-100%, with rates increasing at higher RP), whereas segments with lower RP scores or nonconsensus binding motifs tend to be inactive. Active DNA segments were shown to be occupied by GATA-1 protein by chromatin immunoprecipitation, whereas sites predicted to be inactive were not occupied. We verify four previously known erythroid CRMs and identify 28 novel ones. Thus, high RP in combination with another feature of a CRM, such as a conserved transcription factor binding site, is a good predictor of functional CRMs. Genome-wide predictions based on RP and a large set of well-defined transcription factor binding sites are available through servers at http://www.bx.psu.edu/.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Amino Acid Motifs, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Binding Sites, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, Conserved Sequence, GATA1 Transcription Factor, Gene Expression Profiling, Genes, Reporter, Genome, Humans, K562 Cells, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Mammals, Mice, Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid, Reproducibility of Results, Transfection",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GEO', 'AccessionNumberList': ['GSE2217']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GEO,GSE2217

The treatment outcome for DS-AMKL is more favorable than for AMKL in non-DS patients. To gain insight into gene expression differences in AMKL, we compared 24 DS and 39 non-DS AMKL samples. We found that non-DS-AMKL samples cluster in two groups, characterized by differences in expression of HOX/TALE family members. Both of these groups are distinct from DS-AMKL, independent of chromosome 21 gene expression. To explore alterations of the GATA1 transcriptome, we used cross-species comparison with genes regulated by GATA1 expression in murine erythroid precursors. Genes repressed after GATA1 induction in the murine system, most notably GATA-2, MYC, and KIT, show increased expression in DS-AMKL, suggesting that GATA1s fail to repress this class of genes. Only a subset of genes that are up-regulated upon GATA1 induction in the murine system show increased expression in DS-AMKL, including GATA1 and BACH1, a probable negative regulator of megakaryocytic differentiation located on chromosome 21.

In addition, a variety of tumor cells overexpress cell-surface TF, which appears to be important for tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. To elucidate the mechanism involved in the upregulation of TF in human tumor cells, a comprehensive analysis of TF mRNA from various normal and tumor cells was performed. The results of these studies indicate that, in addition to possessing a normal full-length TF transcript and minor levels of an alternatively spliced transcript known as alternatively-spliced tissue factor (asTF), human tumor cells express additional full-length TF transcripts that are also generated by alternative splicing. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends- (5'-RACE) based analyses of cytoplasmic RNA from normal and tumor cells revealed that there is alternative splicing of the first intron between exon I and exon II resulting in 2 additional TF transcripts. One of the transcripts has an extended exon I with inclusion of most of the first TF intron (955 bp), while the second transcript is formed by the insertion of a 495 bp sequence, referred to as exon IA, derived from an internal sequence of the first intron. The full length TF transcript with alternatively spliced novel exon IA, referred to as alternative exon 1A-tissue factor (TF-A), represented approximately 1% of the total TF transcripts in normal cells, but constituted 7-10% of the total TF transcript in tumor cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that cultured human tumor cells contain 10-25-fold more copy numbers of TF-A in comparison to normal, untransformed cells. We propose that high-level expression of the novel TF-A transcript, preferentially in tumor cells, may have utility in the diagnosis and staging of a variety of solid tumors.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","Adenocarcinoma, Alternative Splicing, Base Sequence, Carcinoma, Hepatocellular, Carcinoma, Transitional Cell, Cytoplasm, Exons, Humans, Introns, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Liver Neoplasms, Molecular Sequence Data, Neoplasm Staging, Neoplasms, Pancreatic Neoplasms, RNA, RNA, Messenger, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Thromboplastin, Tumor Cells, Cultured, Up-Regulation",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['AY940729', 'AY940730', 'AY940731']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement('Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', attributes={'UI': 'D052061'})]",GENBANK,AY940729

All qrt-PCR assays with null alleles and indels attained a sensitivity of at least 10(-4), as well as good intra- and interassay concordance, and a high accuracy in experiments with cell mixtures.

Yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that FHL3 bound MZF-1 in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of FHL3 in KU812 cells suppressed the beta-chain promoter activity through the element in the fourth intron in an MZF-1-dependent manner.

From an AML-M5 with a t(9;11)(q34;q23), we identified a novel MLL fusion partner, AF9Q34. The AF9Q34 protein shows high homology with nGAP, a RAS GTPase-activating protein (RASGAP), and contains the highly conserved GRD and FLR motifs characteristic of RASGAPs. Recently, the rat homologue (DAB2IP) also was identified and reported to act as a RASGAP both in vivo and in vitro. RASGAPs negatively regulate the activity of RAS proteins that modulate diverse cellular processes by cycling between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-bound state. In addition, the NH(2) terminus harbors an amino acid stretch with homology to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain implicated in regulating the interaction between RAS and the catalytic domain of RASGAP. As a result of the breakpoint in the AF9Q34-MLL fusion protein, this PH domain is disrupted. This suggests that because of the translocation, the normal function of the AF9Q34 gene is aborted. Thus, AF9Q34 encodes a novel RASGAP gene that appears to be deregulated as a result of the translocation. The identification of this RASGAP protein in a novel MLL fusion implies that an indirect RAS-deregulating mechanism could be involved in leukemic transformation.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Carrier Proteins, Cell Line, Tumor, Chromosome Breakage, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9, DNA-Binding Proteins, Fatty Acid-Binding Proteins, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, HL-60 Cells, HeLa Cells, Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase, Humans, Jurkat Cells, K562 Cells, Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute, Male, Middle Aged, Molecular Sequence Data, Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein, Oncogene Proteins, Fusion, Organ Specificity, Proto-Oncogenes, Transcription Factors, Translocation, Genetic, U937 Cells, ras GTPase-Activating Proteins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['AY032952']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Comparative Study', attributes={'UI': 'D003160'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,AY032952

DLX1 is the product of a member of the distal-less homeobox gene family, which is known to have important roles in embryogenesis, particularly in craniofacial development, and in GABAergic neurogenesis. DLX1 has been reported to be temporally and spatially coexpressed with BMP-4 during embryogenesis in selected contexts. We report here that, in addition to the previously reported regions/cells, DLX1 is expressed in hematopoietic cells in a lineage-dependent manner and that DLX1 interacts with Smad4 through its homeodomain. We show that it blocks multiple signals from TGF-beta superfamily cytokines such as activin A, TGF-beta1, and BMP-4, including differentiation of a hematopoietic cell line by activin A.

Etoposide-, etoposide metabolite- and doxorubicin-induced DNA topoisomerase II cleavage was examined in normal homologues of the MLL and AF-9 breakpoint sequences using an in vitro assay. Induction of DNA topoisomerase II cleavage complexes in CEM and K562 cell lines was investigated using an in vivo complex of enzyme assay. The translocation occurred between identical 5'-TATTA-3' sequences in MLL intron 8 and AF-9 intron 5 without the gain or loss of bases. The 5'-TATTA-3' sequences were reciprocally cleaved by DNA topoisomerase II in the presence of etoposide, etoposide catechol or etoposide quinone, creating homologous 4-base 5' overhangs that would anneal to form both breakpoint junctions without any processing. der(11) and der(4) translocation breakpoints in a treatment-related ALL at the same site in MLL are consistent with a damage hotspot. Etoposide and both etoposide metabolites induced DNA topoisomerase II cleavage complexes in the hematopoietic cell lines.

We cloned the coding region of a retinoic acid-induced gene from a human thymus library, which was the mRNA encoding the 666-amino acid human homologue of mouse proline-rich protein 76. We have designated it RARP1 (retinoic acid response proline-rich protein 1). Transcription of an approximately 2.4-kbp mRNA occurred mainly in organs with immune functions, such as thymus, spleen, and peripheral leukocytes. Cycloheximide blocked the ATRA-induced expression. In megakaryocyte-like human erythroleukemia HEL cells, the amount of RARP1 mRNA was high, but it was low in human T-lymphoblastoid Jurkat cells. A specific antibody against RARP1 recognized a 110-kDa protein, which accumulates after incubation of HL-60 cells with ATRA. In immunohistochemical experiments, strong RARP1 staining was observed in the megakaryocytes of bone marrow and spleen, and heterogeneous stain was seen in thymus. Transcriptional studies showed that RARP1 expression impaired the transactivation through activator protein1 and serum response-element in all cell lines we checked, whereas it did not affect the transactivation through cAMP-response element in the same cell lines. Further analysis demonstrated that proline-rich regions of RARP1 are the functional regions regulated for suppression of activator protein1 transactivation.

When fused upstream to a luciferase reporter gene, 5' genomic regions of the DDA3 gene containing RE2 were shown to be responsive to the wild-type, but not mutant p53, in a transient transfection assay. RE2 was sufficient to confer the transactivation responsiveness to p53. Furthermore, gel mobility shift analysis showed that RE2 formed specific complexes with wild-type p53. Induction of DDA3 was found in adriamycin treated normal mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEF), but not in p53 knockout (p53(-/-)) MEF. Overexpression of p73 induced DDA3 mRNA expression, and luciferase reporter analysis indicated that RE2 was responsive to transactivation by members of the p73 family proteins. Consistent with these findings, elevated expression of p73 protein and DDA3 mRNA were observed concomitantly in the p53(-/-) MEF cells treated with cisplatin.

The RAR(alpha) gene has drawn particular attention because it is the common target in all chromosomal translocations in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a unique model in cancer research that responds to the effect of RA. In the great majority of patients with APL, RAR(alpha) is fused to the PML gene as a result of the t(15;17) translocation. Three distinct types of PML-RAR(alpha) transcripts, long (L), short (S), and variant (V), were identified. The V-type is characterized by truncation of exon 6 of PML and in some cases by the insertion of a variable ""spacer"" sequence between the truncated PML and RAR(alpha) mRNA fusion partners, although the precise mechanisms underlying formation of the V-type transcript remain unclear. To get further insights into the molecular basis of the t(15;17), we sequenced the entire genomic DNA region of RAR(alpha). Of note, all previously reported ""spacer"" sequences in V-type transcripts were found in intron 2 of the RAR(alpha) gene and most of these sequences were flanked by gt splice donor sites. In most cases, these ""cryptic"" coding sequences maintained the ORF of the chimeric transcript. Interestingly, two cases with a relatively long spacer sequence showed APL cellular and clinical resistance to RA treatment. In these cases, the aberrant V-type PML-RAR(alpha) protein displayed increased affinity to the nuclear corepressor protein SMRT, providing further evidence that RA exerts the therapeutic effect on APL through modulation of the RAR-corepressor interaction. Finally, among patients with the L- or S-type PML-RAR(alpha) fusion transcript, some consensus motifs were identified at the hotspots of the chromosome 17q breakpoints within intron 2 of RAR(alpha), strengthening the importance of this intron in the molecular pathogenesis of APL.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Antineoplastic Agents, Base Sequence, Drug Resistance, Neoplasm, Genetic Variation, Humans, Introns, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Neoplasm Proteins, Oncogene Proteins, Fusion, Receptors, Retinoic Acid, Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha, Retinoid X Receptors, Sequence Alignment, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid, Transcription Factors, Transcription, Genetic, Tretinoin",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['AC090426']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,AC090426

We identified a new member of the Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP) family of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors, designating it RasGRP4. Subsequently, cDNA sequences encoding rodent and human RasGRP4 proteins were deposited in GenBank. RasGRP4 contains the same protein domain structure as other members of the RasGRP family, including a Ras exchange motif, a CDC25 homology domain, a C1/diacyglycerol-binding domain, and putative calcium-binding EF hands.

We demonstrated that 32D myeloid cells expressing RasGRP4 have elevated levels of activated Ras compared with control cells, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment greatly enhanced Ras activation. PMA induced membrane localization of RasGRP4 and 32D cells expressing RasGRP4 were capable of cytokine-independent proliferation in the presence of PMA. We conclude that RasGRP4 is a member of the RasGRP family of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors that may play a role in myeloid cell signaling growth regulation pathways that are responsive to diacylglycerol levels.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, Cytokines, Genes, ras, Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Rats, Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate, ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['AF448437']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,AF448437

To test the disease potential and specificity of this unique FeLV LTR, we replaced the U3 region of the LTR of the erythroleukemia-inducing Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) with that of FeLV clone 33. When the resulting virus, F33V, was injected into newborn mice, almost all of the mice eventually developed hematopoietic malignancies, with a significant percentage being in the myeloid lineage. This is in contrast to mice injected with an F-MuLV recombinant containing the U3 region of another FeLV that lacks repetitive URE sequences, none of which developed myeloid malignancies. Examination of tumor proviruses from F33V-infected mice failed to detect any changes in FeLV U3 sequences other than that in the URE. Like F-MuLV-infected mice, those infected with the F-MuLV/FeLV recombinants were able to generate and replicate mink cell focus-inducing viruses.

During erythrocytic differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells induced by dimethylsulfoxide, expression of TfR1 increased, whereas TfR2 decreased. In MEL cells, expression of TfR1 was induced by desferrioxamine, an iron chelator, and it was reduced by ferric nitrate. In contrast, levels of TfR2 were not affected by the cellular iron status.

Sp100 represses the MAR-binding and transactivation activity of Bright. LYSp100B interacts more weakly with Bright but requires significantly higher levels than Sp100 to inhibit MAR binding.

The t(8;16) fuses the MOZ gene from 8p11 with the CBP (also named CREBBP) gene from 16p13. Previously published studies of MOZ and CBP rearrangements in t(8;16)-positive AML have used fluorescence in situ hybridization and Southern blot methodologies, whereas attempts to amplify and to analyze further the chimeric MOZ-CBP and CBP-MOZ transcripts by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have largely been unsuccessful. In the only t(8;16) that has been described at the sequence level using RT-PCR, the CBP-MOZ fusion was found to be out-of-frame, suggesting that the reciprocal MOZ-CBP transcript is the essential one for leukemogenesis. We have developed an RT-PCR strategy that enables us to detect the MOZ-CBP as well as the CBP-MOZ fusions in the two AML M5 with t(8;16)(p11;p13) analyzed. In both leukemias, the combination of a MOZ forward and a CBP reverse primer amplified a strongly expressed 1,128 bp fragment (type I transcript) and a weakly expressed 415 bp fragment (type II transcript). In the type I transcript, nucleotide (nt) 3,745 of MOZ was fused in-frame with nt 284 of CBP, whereas in the type II transcript, nt 3,745 of MOZ was fused out-of-frame with nt 997 of CBP. Nested PCR with a combination of two forward CBP and two reverse MOZ primers amplified CBP-MOZ chimeric transcripts in both cases. Direct sequence analysis showed that nt 283 of CBP was fused in-frame with nt 3,746 of MOZ, that the initiation ATG codon of the CBP gene remained intact, and that there was no mutation or deletion in the part of the CBP gene included in the CBP-MOZ transcript. Thus, the data we present are not informative with regard to the question whether it is the MOZ-CBP or the CBP-MOZ transcript that is leukemogenic.

GATA-binding sites are consistently found in promoters or enhancers of genes expressed selectively in erythroid cells. To discover novel GATA-1-regulated genes, we searched for GATA-1-activated transcripts in G1E cells, an erythroid line derived from GATA-1(-) embryonic stem cells. By subtractive analysis, we identified a new ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter that is strongly and rapidly induced by GATA-1. This protein, named ABC-me (for ABC-mitochondrial erythroid), localizes to the mitochondrial inner membrane and is expressed at particularly high levels in erythroid tissues of embryos and adults. ABC-me is induced during erythroid maturation in cell lines and primary hematopoietic cells, and its overexpression enhances hemoglobin synthesis in erythroleukemia cells. The ABC proteins participate in diverse physiological processes by coupling ATP hydrolysis to the transport of a variety of substrates across cell membranes. We speculate that ABC-me, a newly identified erythroid-expressed ABC superfamily member, may mediate critical mitochondrial transport functions related to heme biosynthesis.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Carrier Proteins, Cell Differentiation, Cell Line, DNA, Complementary, DNA-Binding Proteins, Erythroid Precursor Cells, Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors, Erythropoiesis, Fetal Proteins, GATA1 Transcription Factor, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Genes, Reporter, Hematopoietic System, Heme, Hemoglobins, Intracellular Membranes, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Membrane Proteins, Mice, Mitochondria, Models, Molecular, Molecular Sequence Data, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Rats, Recombinant Fusion Proteins, Sequence Alignment, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Transcription Factors, Transcription, Genetic, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['AF266284']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Comparative Study', attributes={'UI': 'D003160'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,AF266284

In an effort to isolate and characterize genes whose expression change during differentiation, we cloned and sequenced a cDNA of 715 bp (rpS5) from a MEL cDNA library. The cloned mouse cDNA showed significant degree of structural homology in both DNA and protein level to known human and rat genes that encode the S5 proteins of 40S ribosomal subunit. The use of 715-bp cDNA as probe revealed the presence of an RNA transcript in the cytoplasm of MEL and human neuroectodermal RD/TE-671 cells. The steady-state accumulation level of this RNA transcript decreased upon induction of differentiation of both cell lines by treatment with DMSO and UDP-4, two structurally different inducers. Blockade of MEL cell differentiation by the inhibitor N6-methyladenosine preserved the constitutive expression of the rpS5 gene. DNA methylation analysis at CCGG sites located at the rpS5 gene locus in undifferentiated and differentiated MEL cells revealed that the suppression of the rpS5 gene during MEL cell differentiation is not related to any change in methylation at these sites. Moreover, the rpS5 gene continued to be expressed in cells undergoing serum-deprived apoptosis, like in control untreated cells. Therefore, we conclude that there may be a disparate pattern of expression of the rpS5 gene in differentiating and apoptotic cells. These data can be valuable in understanding the role of ribosomal proteins during differentiation and cell death (apoptosis) of neoplastic cells, although there is no experimental evidence that the suppression of the rpS5 gene is related mechanistically to the induction of differentiation.

Recently, we provided the evidence for specific P4.2 expression in erythroid cells during development (L. Zhu et al., 1998, Blood 91, 695-705). Using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells as a model, transcription of the P4.2 gene was found to be induced during erythroid differentiation. To examine the mechanism for this induction, we isolated the mouse P4.2 genomic DNA containing the 5' flanking sequence and defined the location of the P4.2 promoter. Transcription of the mouse P4.2 gene initiates at multiple sites, with the major initiation site mapped at 174 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon. The mouse P4.2 promoter is TATA-less and contains multiple potential binding sites for erythroid transcription factors GATA-1, NF-E2, EKLF, and tal-1/SCL. Transient transfection experiments demonstrated that a 1.7-kb mouse P4.2 promoter fused with the luciferase coding regions was induced in DMSO-treated MEL cells. Deletion analysis showed that a 259-bp P4.2 promoter DNA (nucleotide position -88 to +171 relative to the major transcription initiation site designated +1), containing a GATA-binding site at position -29 to -24, could still respond to the induction in differentiated MEL cells. Importantly, mutations in the -29/-24 GATA motif rendered the promoter unresponsive to DMSO induction. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that GATA-1 could bind to the -29/-24 GATA motif and this was confirmed by the observation that the nuclear protein bound to the motif was supershifted by an anti-GATA-1 monoclonal antibody.

Here, the molecular cloning and role in hematopoiesis of a human gene (designated HnudC) homologous to A. nidulans nudC is reported. The amino terminus of the larger human protein (HNUDC = 45 kDa) does not overlap with A. nidulans NUDC (22 kDa). However, NUDC and the C-terminal 94 amino acids of HNUDC are 67% identical. The C-terminal region of the HnudC gene fully complements the A. nidulans temperature-sensitive nudC3 mutation, suggesting that nudC has an essential function in cell growth that is conserved from filamentous fungi to humans. In initial studies, HNUDC levels were much higher in erythroid precursors compared to most other human tissues. Therefore, the potential role of HnudC in hematopoiesis was explored. In normal human bone marrow, HNUDC protein and mRNA are highly expressed in early myeloid and erythroid precursors and decline as these cells terminally differentiate. To determine whether hematopoietic growth factors induce HnudC expression, TF-1 cells were stimulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. This induced a significant increase in HNUDC protein and HnudC mRNA, suggesting that enhancement of HnudC expression in response to growth factor stimulation may be mediated at the transcription level. Furthermore, HNUDC was significantly enhanced in lysates of bone marrow aspirates from patients with acute myelogenous and acute lymphoblastic leukemia compared to aspirates from normal controls, suggesting that HnudC is involved in malignant hematopoietic cell growth as well.

To determine whether transcriptional regulatory mechanisms account for the synaptic accumulation of AChE transcripts at the mammalian neuromuscular synapse, we cloned a 5.3-kb DNA fragment that contained the 5' regulatory region of the rat AChE gene and generated several constructs in which AChE promoter fragments were placed upstream of the reporter gene lacZ and a nuclear localization signal (nls). Using a recently described transient expression assay system in intact skeletal muscle, we show that this AChE promoter fragment directs the synapse-specific expression of the reporter gene. Deletion analysis revealed that a 499-bp fragment located in the first intron of the AChE gene is essential for expression in muscle fibers. Further analysis showed that sequences contained within this intronic fragment were (i) functionally independent of position and orientation and (ii) inactive in hematopoietic cells. Disruption of an N-box motif located within this DNA fragment reduced by more than 80% the expression of the reporter gene in muscle fibers.

This gene is highly expressed in the yolk sac and fetal liver of the knockin mice. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that its cDNA contains an 1,107-bp open reading frame encoding a 368-amino-acid polypeptide. Further protein sequence and protein translation analysis shows that it belongs to a family of ubiquitin-specific proteases (UBP), and its molecular mass is 43 kDa. Therefore, we have named this gene UBP43. Like other ubiquitin proteases, the UBP43 protein has deubiquitinating enzyme activity. Protein ubiquitination has been implicated in many important cellular events. In wild-type adult mice, UBP43 is highly expressed in the thymus and in peritoneal macrophages. Among nine different murine hematopoietic cell lines analyzed, UBP43 expression is detectable only in cell lines related to the monocytic lineage. Furthermore, its expression is regulated during cytokine-induced monocytic cell differentiation. We have investigated its function in the hematopoietic myeloid cell line M1. UBP43 was introduced into M1 cells by retroviral gene transfer, and several high-expressing UBP43 clones were obtained for further study. Morphologic and cell surface marker examination of UBP43/M1 cells reveals that overexpression of UBP43 blocks cytokine-induced terminal differentiation of monocytic cells. These data suggest that UBP43 plays an important role in hematopoiesis by modulating either the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway or the ubiquitination state of another regulatory factor(s) during myeloid cell differentiation.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, Cell Differentiation, Cloning, Molecular, Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit, DNA-Binding Proteins, Endopeptidases, Hematopoiesis, Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Leukemia, Experimental, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Macrophages, Mice, Mice, Knockout, Mice, Mutant Strains, Molecular Sequence Data, Monocytes, Oncogene Proteins, Fusion, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein, Recombinant Fusion Proteins, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Substrate Specificity, Transcription Factors, Ubiquitin Thiolesterase, Ubiquitins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['AF069502']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,AF069502

We identified a cDNA encoding p22 HBP, and sequence analysis revealed that p22 HBP comprises 190 amino acid residues (Mr 21,063) and has no homology to any other known heme-binding protein. The p22 HBP mRNA (approximately 1.0 kilobases) is ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and is extremely abundant in the liver. cDNA allows for expression of active p22 HBP, with a high affinity for 55Fe-hemin, with a Kd of 26 +/-1.8 nM. The Bmax of hemin binding to p22 HBP was 0.55 +/- 0.021 mol/mol of protein, a value consistent with one heme molecule binding per molecule of protein. The order of potency of different ligands to compete against 55Fe-hemin binding to p22 HBP was hemin = protoporphyrin IX > coproporphyrin III > bilirubin > palmitic acid > all-trans-retinoic acid. Treatment of mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells with dimethyl sulfoxide or hemin resulted in an increase in p22 HBP mRNA. The immunoblot analysis showed that p22 HBP increased with time in dimethyl sulfoxide- and hemin-induced MEL cells. Conversely, transfer of antisense oligonucleotides to p22 HBP cDNA resulted in a decrease of p22 HBP in dimethyl sulfoxide-treated MEL cells, and the heme content in these cells decreased to 66-71% of sense oligonucleotides-transferred cells.

Its extracellular domain binds von Willebrand factor (vWF) and thrombin, while its intracellular domain associates tightly with the cytoskeleton through the actin-binding protein (ABP)-280, also known as filamin. In the present study, a full-length cDNA coding for a human ABP homologue has been cloned and sequenced. This protein was identified by the yeast two-hybrid screening procedure via its interaction with the intracellular domain of GPIbalpha. Initially, a 1.3-kb partial cDNA was isolated from a megakaryocyte-like cell line (K562) cDNA library followed by a full-length cDNA of 9.4 kb that was identified in a human placenta library. The full-length cDNA encoded a protein of 2,578 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 276 kD (ABP-276). The amino terminal 248 amino acids contained an apparent actin binding domain followed by 24 tandem repeats each containing about 96 amino acids.

However, the 32 amino acid Hinge I region in ABP-280 that contains a calpain cleavage site conferring flexibility on the molecule, was absent in the homologue. An isoform containing a 24 amino acid insertion with a unique sequence at the missing Hinge I region was also identified (ABP-278). This isoform resulted from alternative RNA splicing.

High titers of the LISN retrovirus were produced by the amphotropic packaging cell line GP+envAM12. LISN is able to infect three human hematopoietic and leukemic cell lines: K562, LAMA-84, and TF-1. G418-resistant cells were detected in a similar proportion after infection with either the LISN retroviral vector or the LnLSN retroviral vector (encoding the nlsLacZ gene instead of hIFN-alpha2), suggesting that hIFN-alpha2 does not inhibit (or only partially inhibits) the production of retroviral particles by the packaging cell line and the infection of human cells. LISN-infected cells express and secrete hIFN-alpha2 as demonstrated by Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA, detection of the intracellular protein by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, and detection of secreted hIFN-alpha in cell supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Retrovirally produced hIFN-alpha2 is biologically active, as demonstrated by the partial inhibition of the growth of K562 and TF-1, the modulation of the expression of cell surface antigens, the induction of the (2'-5') oligoadenylate synthetase, and, for LAMA-84, the down-modulation of the BCR-ABL protein. We conclude that the infection of human leukemic cell lines with a retroviral vector encoding hIFN-alpha2 is feasible and induces the expected biological effects.

Yet, the physiological role of these nuclear bodies remains unknown. Here, we show that SP100 binds to members of the heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) families of non-histone chromosomal proteins. Further, we demonstrate that a naturally occurring splice variant of SP100, here called SP100-HMG, is a member of the high mobility group-1 (HMG-1) protein family and may thus possess DNA-binding potential. Both HP1 and SP100-HMG concentrate in the PML/SP100 NBs, and overexpression of SP100 leads to enhanced accumulation of endogenous HP1 in these structures. When bound to a promoter, SP100, SP100-HMG and HP1 behave as transcriptional repressors in transfected mammalian cells.

The mouse TERT is widely expressed at low levels in adult tissues, with greatest abundance during embryogenesis and in adult thymus and intestine. The mTERT component mRNA levels were regulated during both differentiation and proliferation, while mTR levels remained constant throughout both processes. Comparison of mTERT and mTR levels to telomerase activity indicates that mTERT expression is more tightly linked to the regulation of telomerase activity during these processes than is mTR. In contrast to the situation in human cell cultures, mTERT transcript levels are present at readily detectable levels in primary cultured cells and are not upregulated following crisis. The widespread expression of mTERT in primary cells and mouse tissues could explain the increased frequency of spontaneous immortalization of mouse cells in culture and tumorigenesis in vivo.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","3T3 Cells, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, Cell Differentiation, Cells, Cultured, Cellular Senescence, Chromosome Mapping, DNA, Complementary, DNA-Binding Proteins, Down-Regulation, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Humans, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Mitogens, Molecular Sequence Data, Nucleoproteins, Proteins, RNA, RNA, Long Noncoding, RNA, Untranslated, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Spleen, Telomerase, Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate, Tissue Distribution, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['AF051911']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,AF051911

A retroviral vector that does not encode any Env glycoprotein was packaged into retroviral particles and was coinjected into mice in the presence of a nonpathogenic helper virus. Although most mice remained healthy, one mouse developed splenomegaly and polycythemia at 67 days; the virus from this mouse reproducibly caused the same symptoms in secondary recipients by 2 to 3 weeks postinfection. This disease, which was characterized by extramedullary erythropoietin-independent erythropoiesis in the spleens and livers, was also reproduced in long-term bone marrow cultures. Viruses from the diseased primary mouse and from secondary recipients converted an erythropoietin-dependent cell line (BaF3/EpoR) into factor-independent derivatives but had no effect on the interleukin-3-dependent parental BaF3 cells. Most of these factor-independent cell clones contained a major Env-related glycoprotein with an Mr of 60,000. During further in vivo passaging, a virus that encodes an Mr-55,000 glycoprotein became predominant. Sequence analysis indicated that the ultimate virus is a new SFFV that encodes a glycoprotein of 410 amino acids with the hallmark features of classical gp55s. Our results suggest that SFFV-related viruses can form in mice by recombination of retroviruses with genomic and helper virus sequences and that these novel viruses then evolve to become increasingly pathogenic.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, Biological Evolution, Bone Marrow Cells, Cell Line, Cells, Cultured, DNA, Viral, Female, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Mice, Mice, Inbred DBA, Molecular Sequence Data, Polycythemia, Receptors, Erythropoietin, Retroviridae Infections, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses, Splenomegaly, Tumor Virus Infections",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['AF030182']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,AF030182

There are two forms of the receptor that have been previously cloned, and both are generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. Here we report the cloning of a third, alternatively spliced isoform of the human SR-A gene (type III hSR-A). The novel isoform is expressed in the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 and also in primary human monocyte derived macrophages. When expressed in CHO-K1 cells, type III hSR-A does not internalize AcLDL despite having the domain shown to mediate this function in type I and II hSR-A. We show that type III protein has altered intracellular processing and is trapped within the endoplasmic reticulum, making it unable to perform endocytosis. Type III protein acts as a dominant negative isoform by reducing modified LDL uptake in CHO cells stably expressing either type I or type II SR-A. The demonstration that a naturally occurring splice variant of SR-A mRNA can act as a dominant negative isoform suggests a novel mechanism for regulation of scavenger receptor activity in macrophages.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Alternative Splicing, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, CHO Cells, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Cloning, Molecular, Cricetinae, Fluorescent Dyes, Gene Expression, Humans, Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute, Lipoproteins, LDL, Macrophages, Molecular Sequence Data, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Receptors, Immunologic, Receptors, Scavenger, Scavenger Receptors, Class A, Transfection, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['AF037351']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,AF037351

To study AQP1 gene regulation, human cell lines were screened for inducible AQP1 expression. Human erythroleukemia HEL cells showed AQP1 transcript expression on RNase protection assay. After butyrate-induced erythroid differentiation, AQP1 transcript expression increased strongly, producing water-permeable cells with plasma membrane localization of immunoreactive AQP1. In addition, a clonal subline of K562 cells [K562(S)] showed strong butyrate-induced expression of functional AQP1. A 1.8-kb DNA fragment of the 5' flanking region of the human AQP1 gene was isolated, sequenced, and analyzed functionally by the CAT reporter assay. The AQP1 promoter contained TATA and CCAAT boxes; Sp1, AP1, AP2, and E-box elements; and erythrocyte-specific CACCC and Kruppel-like (CCCCACCCA) elements. AQP1 promoter activity was more than 24-fold higher in HEL and K562(S) cells than in nonerythroid (HeLa) cells, indicating the presence of erythroid-specific factors. In K562(S) cells, CAT activities for promoter fragments to bp +23 [relative to beta-gal and normalized to 100% for the plasmid CP-282 (bp -282 to +23)] were 22 (-1779), 73 (-1402), 61 (-1129), 31 (-789), 87 (-487), 100 (-282), 73 (-229), 52 (-152), and 60% (-79). After butyrate-induced differentiation, CAT activities were stimulated approximately 10-fold for constructs -229/+23 and longer, compared to approximately 5-fold for -152/+23 and -79/+23; glucocorticoids did not affect CAT activities.

This gene spans approximately 14 kb and encodes a 1.8-kb mRNA detected at the highest levels in peripheral blood leukocytes and breast cancer cell lines. The open reading frame predicts a 248-amino-acid protein with the hydropathic characteristics of a type 1a membrane protein. Western blots show that the K12 protein exists as a cluster of bands around 27 kDa, and extractions using nonionic detergents or high pH conditions demonstrate that it behaves as an integral membrane protein. Immunofluorescence localization studies reveal that K12 is not detectable on the cell surface, but instead is found in a perinuclear Golgi-like pattern and colocalizes with a well-known Golgi marker. In addition, an approximately 20-kDa soluble form of the K12 protein derived from the N-terminal domain is specifically secreted by cells into the culture medium. Immunohistochemical analysis of peripheral blood cells shows that K12 is found in leukocytes of the myeloid lineage, with the strongest staining observed in granulocytes and no detectable expression in lymphocytes. Based on its range of expression, its broad structural characteristics that resemble cytokines and growth factors, and the chromosomal location of the gene in an area already associated with myelogenous leukemias and other malignant neoplasms, this study concludes that K12 is a novel molecule with potential importance in hematopoietic and/or immune system processes.","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Antigens, CD7, Blotting, Western, Breast Neoplasms, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17, Cloning, Molecular, Gene Expression, Golgi Apparatus, Humans, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Leukocytes, Membrane Proteins, Molecular Sequence Data, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Subcellular Fractions, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['U77643']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,U77643

A potential candidate for these replication control sequences was the 3' regulatory region of the Igh locus. Our results demonstrate, however, that the Igh locus maintains early replication in a B-cell line in which the 3' regulatory region has been deleted from one allele, thus indicating that replication timing of the locus is independent of this region. In non-B cells (murine erythroleukemia cells [MEL]), previous studies of segments within the mouse Igh locus demonstrated that DNA replication likely initiated downstream of the Igh gene cluster. Here we use recently cloned DNA to demonstrate that segments located sequentially downstream of the Igh 3' regulatory region continue to replicate progressively earlier in S phase in MEL. Furthermore, analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis indicates that replication forks proceed exclusively in the 3'-to-5' direction through the region 3' of the Igh locus. Extrapolation from these data predicts that initiation of DNA replication occurs in MEL at one or more sites within a 90-kb interval located between 40 and 130 kb downstream of the 3' regulatory region.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Animals, B-Lymphocytes, Cell Line, DNA Replication, Genes, Immunoglobulin, Globins, Humans, Hybrid Cells, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Mice, Multiple Myeloma, Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid, Replicon, S Phase, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['AF005484', 'AF017981', 'AF017982', 'AF019135']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,AF005484

In more than 99% of cases, this disruption results in the formation of a PML-RARA gene fusion. Two rare variants of APL have been described, in which RARA is fused to one of two other genes, PLZF and NPM. Although RARA dysregulation is evidently important in APL, the role of the various fusion partners remains unclear. We have characterized a fourth APL gene fusion, which links exons encoding the retinoic acid and DNA-binding domains of RARA to 5' exons of NuMA, a gene that encodes the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein. The NuMA-RARA fusion protein exists in sheet-like nuclear aggregates with which normal NuMA partly co-localizes. In contrast to t(15;17) APL, the intracellular distribution of PML is normal in these cells. Our results suggest that interference with retinoid signalling, and not disruption of PML organization, is essential to the APL phenotype and implicates for the first time an element of the mitotic apparatus in the molecular pathogenesis of human malignancy.","Case Reports, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Amino Acid Sequence, Antigens, Nuclear, Base Sequence, Bone Marrow, Cell Cycle Proteins, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17, DNA Primers, Female, Genetic Variation, Humans, Infant, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Male, Molecular Sequence Data, Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins, Nuclear Proteins, Organ Specificity, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Receptors, Retinoic Acid, Recombinant Fusion Proteins, Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha, Spindle Apparatus, Translocation, Genetic",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['AF012302', 'AF012303', 'AF012304']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Case Reports', attributes={'UI': 'D002363'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,AF012302

In this study we report on the cloning of the rat C5a receptor (ratC5aR). We used a hybridization probe produced by PCR utilizing degenerate primers which corresponded to conserved parts of the human, canine and murine C5a receptor nucleotide sequences and to the published partial amino acid sequence of the rat C5a receptor to screen a rat macrophage cDNA library. We found two overlapping clones containing an open reading frame of 1056 bp, a 3'untranslated region of 683 bp and a 5'untranslated region of 27 bp. The overall nucleotide acid sequence identity, compared to the murine, human and canine C5a receptor sequences, was 85.8, 70.5 and 68.9%, respectively. The greatest diversity exists in the putative extracellular domains, especially in the aminoterminal domain which is assumed to be involved in ligand binding. An N-glycosylation site is present within the N-terminal sequence at residue 6. One of the cDNA containing the 5'untranslated region, the coding sequence and part of the 3'untranslated region was cloned into an eucaryotic expression vector and stably transfected into the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3. Expression of the rat C5a receptor on the surface of these cells could be demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis using FITC-labeled recombinant rat C5a (rrC5a). By measuring the release of calcium from intracellular stores after stimulation with rrC5a it could further be shown that the receptor is functionally coupled. Receptor binding assays showed that rrC5a specifically binds to the ratC5aR with a KD of 0.91 +/- 0.36 and to the human C5a receptor (huC5aR) with a KD of 7.19 +/- 1.56. The determined KD for binding of human C5a (huC5a) to the huCSaR was 2.16 +/- 0.65.

Alpha 4 beta 7-mediated adhesion to mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) directs lymphocyte homing to the gut, and alpha E beta 7 mediates binding of lymphocytes to E-cadherin on epithelial cells. Since alpha 4 beta 7 mediates adhesion to MAdCAM-1 but alpha 4 beta 1 does not, we used beta 7/beta 1 chimeras to directly assess the importance of specific regions of beta 7 in MAdCAM-1 binding. We found a region of beta 7 (residues 46-386) that accounts for specificity of alpha 4 beta 7 binding to MAdCAM-1. We also used human/mouse and human/rat chimeric beta 7 subunits to map epitopes recognized by fifteen anti-beta 7 mAbs. Six of seven Abs that block adhesion to MAdCAM-1 and E-cadherin (Fib 21, 22, 27, 30, 504; Act-1) mapped to amino acid residues 176-250. Residues 176-250 lie within the region of beta 7 that specifies MAdCAM-1 binding and also within a region that has a predicted structure homologous to the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) domains of the integrin subunits alpha L and alpha M. Three new Abs that recognize beta 7 in the presence of Mn2+, but not Ca2+, and promote adhesion to MAdCAM-1, mapped to amino acids 46-149.

The shorter of these new isoforms, called B3, presents an open reading frame (ORF) of 1713 bp coding for 571 amino acids. Its nucleotide sequence is homologous to the cDNA coding for the ABCDF isoform of ZNF162, except for a 4-nucleotide insertion that results in a frame shift of the ORF starting from nucleotide 1725 of the ZNF162 sequence. As a consequence, the predicted translation product of B3 contains the consensus sequence of the A motif (G-X-X-X-X-G-K-S) of the ""ATP/ GTP binding site,"" which is characteristic of several protein families including protein kinases. Moreover, B3 shows the use of a different stop codon and contains a different tyrosine-rich COOH terminus. The longer isoform, called B4, differs from the ABCDEF isoform of ZNF162 by the insertion, at position 2137, of 383 nucleotides leading to a different, proline-rich COOH terminus. The complex transcription pattern of the ZNF162 gene is characterized by four transcripts, of approximately 3.9, 3.7, 3.2, and 2.9 kb, in GF-D8 cells. The 3.7- and 2.9-kb transcripts are expressed in resting GF-D8 cells. Upon stimulation with GM-CSF the expression of these mRNAs is up-regulated in parallel with the induction of two additional transcripts of 3.9 and 3.2 kb. The same pattern of expression has also been observed in freshly isolated myeloid leukemia cells and normal CD34+ stem cells. In light of these data, and since GM-CSF is known to stimulate signal transduction pathways, it becomes relevant that all the different isoforms of ZNF162 contain the KH module, which is a sequence motif present in proteins playing a major role in regulating cellular RNA metabolism. A search for functional domains demonstrates that ZNF162 belongs to a new and growing family of genes dubbed STAR (signal transduction and activator of RNA) proteins that are thought to play a downstream role in cell signaling and also in RNA binding. The mammalian members include Sam68, which is a target of Src, Fyn, and Grb2, and the newly cloned mouse quaking proteins (qkI) necessary in early embryogenesis and myelination.

Although these subline cells retain their monocytic characteristics in vitro, Mm-A and Mm-P cells are highly leukemogenic to syngeneic SL mice and athymic nude mice, whereas Mm-S1 and Mm-S2 cells are not or are only slightly leukemogenic. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of these levels of leukemogenicity, we investigated putative leukemogenesis-associated genes or oncogenes involved in the maintenance of growth, especially in vivo, by means of differential mRNA display. We isolated a fragment clone (15T01) from Mm-P cells. The mRNA probed with 15T01 was expressed at high levels in leukemogenic Mm-P and Mm-A cells but not in nonleukemogenic Mm-S1 and Mm-S2 cells. The gene corresponding to 15T01, named TRA1, was isolated from an Mm-P cDNA library. The longest open reading frame of the TRA1 clone predicts a peptide containing 204 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 23,049 D. The predicted TRA1 protein is cysteine-rich and contains multiple cysteine doublets. A putative normal counterpart gene, named NOR1, was also isolated from a normal mouse kidney cDNA library and sequenced. NOR1 cDNA predicts a peptide containing 234 amino acids. The sequence of 201 amino acids from the C-terminal NOR1 was completely identical to that of TRA1, whereas the remaining N-terminal amino acids (33 amino acids) were longer than that (3 amino acids) of TRA1 and the N-terminus of NOR1 protein contained proline-rich sequence. A similarity search against current nucleotide and protein sequence databases indicated that the NOR1/TRA1 gene(s) is conserved in a wide range of eukaryotes, because apparently homologous genes were identified in Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes. Northern blotting using TRA1-specific and NOR1-specific probes indicated that TRA1 mRNA is exclusively expressed in leukemogenic but not in nonleukemogenic Mm sublines and normal tissues and also indicated that NOR1 mRNA is expressed in normal tissues, especially in kidney, lung, liver, and bone marrow cells but not in any Mm sublines.

Grb2/Ash and Shc have the SH3, SH2, or phosphotyrosine binding domains. These domains bind to proteins containing proline-rich regions or tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and contribute to the association of Grb2/Ash and Shc with other signaling molecules. However, there could remain unidentified signaling molecules that physically and functionally interact with these adapter proteins and have biologically important roles in the signaling pathways. By using the GST fusion protein including the full length of Grb2/Ash, we have found that c-Cbl and an unidentified 135-kD protein (pp135) are associated with Grb2/Ash. We have also found that they become tyrosine-phosphorylated by treatment of a human leukemia cell line, UT-7, with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We have purified the pp135 by using GST-Grb2/Ash affinity column and have isolated the full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the pp135 using a cDNA probe, which was obtained by the degenerate polymerase chain reaction based on a peptide sequence of the purified pp135. The cloned cDNA has 3,958 nucleotides that contain a single long open reading frame of 3,567 nucleotides, encoding a 1,189 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 133 kD. The deduced amino acid sequence reveals that pp135 is a protein that has one SH2, one SH3, and one proline-rich domain. The pp135, which contains two motifs conserved among the inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase proteins, was shown to have the inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase activity. The pp135 was revealed to associate constitutively with Grb2/Ash and inducibly with Shc using UT-7 cells stimulated with GM-CSF. In the cell lines derived from human chronic myelogenous leukemia, pp135 was constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with Shc and Bcr-Abl. These facts suggest that pp135 is a signaling molecule that has a unique enzymatic activity and should play an important role in the signaling pathway triggered by GM-CSF and in the transformation of hematopoietic cells caused by Bcr-Abl.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing, Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport, Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Cloning, Molecular, DNA, Complementary, Erythropoietin, Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl, GRB2 Adaptor Protein, Genes, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor, Humans, Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Neoplasm Proteins, Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases, Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases, Phosphorylation, Phosphotyrosine, Protein Processing, Post-Translational, Proteins, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl, Recombinant Fusion Proteins, Shc Signaling Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transduction, Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1, Tumor Cells, Cultured, Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases, src Homology Domains",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['U53470']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,U53470

We here report that MAFA is encoded by a single-copy gene that spans 13 kb in the rat genome and is composed of five exons. Three separate exons encode the carbohydrate recognition domain of the MAFA, defining its close homology to the genes of CD23, CD69, CD72, NKR-P1, and Ly49. Functional analysis of the 5' flanking region of the gene reveals that a cell type-specific promoter is located within the first 664 bp upstream of the transcription origin. The promoter lacks any obvious TATA box and drives gene transcription originating from multiple start sites. Examination for possible polymorphism of the MAFA transcripts revealed two novel transcripts, generated by alternative splicing. Deletion of the transmembranal exon in one of them does not result in a frameshift and would, upon translation, give rise to a soluble MAFA molecule. Splicing of two exons in a second transcript results in a new reading frame encoding a putative protein containing MAFA's cytoplasmic domain.

In contrast, several kinds of tumor showed biallelic expression of IGF2, suggesting that relaxation of the normal imprinting of this growth cytokine may be a feature of some tumors. In this study we wished to determine whether relaxation of IGF2 imprinting was also common in human leukemias. An intragenic Apa I polymorphism within the 3' untranslated region of the gene was used to examine allele-specific transcription in leukemic blasts derived from 24 primary patients with acute myeloid leukemia by RT-PCR. Leukemic samples from 12 of the 24 leukemia patients were identified as heterozygous for IGF2 and potentially informative for the RT-PCR assay. RNA-PCR from these informative leukemia samples studied showed biallelic expression of IGF2, indicating loss of normal imprinting of this gene to be very frequent.

However, except for these proteases only fragmentary information has been available on the structure and complexity of proteases expressed by different subpopulations of rat MCs. To address these questions, cDNA libraries were constructed from freshly isolated rat peritoneal MCs and from the rat mucosal MC line RBL-1. cDNA clones for 10 different serine proteases (RMCP-1-10), and the MC carboxypeptidase A were isolated and characterized. Six of these proteases have not been isolated previously. Based on their protease content, three separate subpopulations of MCs were identified. Connective tissue MCs (CTMCs) from the ear and peritoneum express the chymases RMCP-1 and -5, the tryptases RMCP-6, and -7 and the carboxypeptidase A. However, based on a large difference in the level of expression of RMCP-7, CTMCs of these two organs may be regarded as two separate subpopulations. RMCP-2 and the three closely related proteases of the RMCP-8 subfamily were identified as the major mucosal MC proteases in rat. In contrast to what has been reported for human MCs, no expression of cathepsin G or cathepsin G-like proteases was detected in any of the rat MC populations. To determine mRNA frequencies for the various proteases expressed by normal tissue MCs, an unamplified peritoneal MC cDNA library was screened with a panel of mono-specific cDNA probes.

By screening a cDNA library with a probe derived from sequences downstream of the p53p2 start site, we have cloned and characterized a cDNA that represents a mRNA that appears to have been initiated from the p53p2 promoter. We have designated the gene encoding this transcript Hp53int1 (the GDB designation is D17S2179E). The cDNA is 1125 bp and is polyadenylated downstream from a consensus poly(A) addition site. The entire 1125 bp is derived from intron 1 of the p53 gene, with no introns having been removed. The cDNA contains no major open reading frame although reading frame +1 contains a relatively low abundance of stop codons compared to the other two reading frames and could possibly encode a protein of 119 amino acids. Analysis of the +1 reading frame shows a region of high homology to a portion of the DNA-binding domain of NF-kappaB. These results indicate that a novel polyadenylated transcript is encoded by the first intron of the human p53 gene. Hp53int1 may be a pseudogene for a gene that may have encoded a DNA-binding protein.

AF-5alpha, the 11th partner gene fused with MLL, is a novel gene mapped to chromosome 5q12, which encodes a 31 kDa protein of 269 amino acids and contains a possible nuclear targeting sequence, a potential leucine zipper dimerization motif and an alpha-helical coiled-coil domain. In situ hybridization and molecular cloning analyses demonstrated that two different types of chromosomal recombination had occurred in the cells. One was a three-way translocation among chromosomes 6, 8 and 11, and the other was an insertion of a chromosome 5-derived segment into the breakpoint of chromosomes 8 and 11. Accordingly, the karyotype was defined as del(5)(q11.2q12), der(6)t(6;8) (q27;q11.2), der(8)(8pter-->8q11.2::5q11.2-->5q12::11q23-->++ +11qter), der(11)t(6;11) (q27;q23). Thus, the MLL gene created two different fusion mRNAs, since the chromosome 11 split into two different chromosomes 5 and 6. This is the first report demonstrating fusion of the MLL gene with two different genes by a complex translocation.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Base Sequence, Blotting, Northern, Chromosome Mapping, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8, Cloning, Molecular, DNA-Binding Proteins, Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase, Humans, Infant, Kinesins, Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute, Male, Molecular Sequence Data, Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein, Myosins, Nuclear Proteins, Proto-Oncogenes, Transcription Factors, Translocation, Genetic",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['R50104']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,R50104

In its aa sequence (837 and 881 aa, calculated pIs: 9.33 and 9.38, mol wts 92,750 and 97,410 kD), it is conspicuously related to the 80-kD plakophilin 1, with which it shares a central region of 9 repeats of the arm-motif, preceeded by a long head region and followed by a very short (11 aa) carboxy-terminal sequence. Plakophilin 2 and its mRNA have been detected in a wide range of tissues and cell types, including cells devoid of desmosomes. By light and electron microscopical immunolocalization, plakophilin 2 has been localized to plaques of desmosomes of one-layered (""simple"") and complex epithelia, carcinomas, diverse epithelium-derived cell culture lines, as well as cardiac tissue and the dendritic reticulum cells of lymphatic germinal centers, i.e., desmosomes in which plakophilin 1 is not detected. However, plakophilin 2 has also been localized in the desmosomes of certain but not all stratified epithelia where it coexists with plakophilin 1. Remarkably, plakophilin 2 is also enriched in the karyoplasm of a wide range of cell types, including many that lack desmosomes and in which, therefore, the nuclear state is the only locally enriched form of plakophilin 2 present. We conclude that plakophilins 2a and 2b are basic nuclear proteins that in certain cell types additionally assemble with other proteins to form the desmosomal plaque and serve general nuclear functions as well as a function specific to many but not all desmosomes.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Alternative Splicing, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Breast Neoplasms, Caco-2 Cells, Carcinoma, Squamous Cell, Cattle, Cell Nucleus, Desmosomes, Dogs, Female, Fibroblasts, Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Glioma, Guinea Pigs, HT29 Cells, Humans, Immunoblotting, Isomerism, Keratinocytes, Kidney, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Liver Neoplasms, Macropodidae, Mammary Neoplasms, Animal, Microscopy, Immunoelectron, Molecular Sequence Data, PC12 Cells, Plakophilins, Proteins, Rats, Vulvar Neoplasms",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['X97675']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Comparative Study', attributes={'UI': 'D003160'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,X97675

In addition, we cloned the telomeric 10p junction and we found that the 5' portion of AF10 was juxtaposed to a previously unidentified gene at 11q12, which we call HEAB (a human homolog to a hypothetical Caenorhabditis elegans ATP/GTP-binding protein). These results indicate that the AF10 gene is split into a 5' AF10 and a 3' AF10 portion by the 11q23q12 chromosome segment and that both breakpoint junctions result in fusion transcripts of 5' AF10/HEAB and MLL/3' AF10. Only the MLL/3' AF10 fusion mRNA results in an in-frame fusion. Northern blot analysis of HEAB expression shows that a 2.0-kb major transcript is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues and is especially abundant in testis and skeletal muscle, whereas a 3.2-kb minor transcript is noted with the highest level of expression in thymus and peripheral blood leukocytes. The HEAB gene encodes a 425-amino acid protein that is rich in valine and leucine. HEAB protein shows high homology in its entire amino acid sequence to a putative C elegans protein and contains an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)/guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding motif that has homology to the ATP-binding transporter superfamily or to GTP-binding proteins.

To study the effects of nitric oxide (NO) on the expression of three genes involved in erythroid cell iron metabolism (gamma-globin, H-ferritin, and transferrin receptor [TfR]), we developed a series of human K562 erythroleukemic cell clones retrovirally transduced with inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS-2) and producing different steady-state levels of NO. gamma-Globin and H-ferritin protein expression was reduced in NO-producing cells in relation to the amount of NO produced. Conversely, cell surface TfR expression increased in NO-producing clones. Both the inhibitory effects of NO on gamma-globin and H-ferritin expression and the stimulatory effect on TfR were reversed by the NOS inhibitor NG-methyl-L-arginine (NGMMA). gamma-Globin and H-ferritin mRNA levels were unaffected by NO production. In the case of TfR, NO appeared to stabilize mRNA in that the half life of TfR mRNA decreased from approximately 15 hours to less than 3 hours when NO production by NOS-transduced clones was inhibited. Thus, NO can regulate expression of these genes at the posttranscriptional level, an effect that is likely mediated by the known effect of NO on the RNA binding activity of iron regulatory protein-1 (Pantopoulos and Hentze, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 92:1267, 1995).

E3, one of nine sequences identified, was upregulated in an immediate-early manner, with transcript levels peaking after 60 minutes exposure to RA. E3 transcripts were RA-inducible in HL60 cells, but not in an RA-resistant subclone, HL60R, that harbors a mutated RAR alpha gene. However, when HL60R cells were transduced with a functional copy of the RAR alpha gene, RA induced a 10-fold increase in E3 mRNA levels. E3 transcripts are present in the myeloid, B-lymphoid, and erythroid lineages, absent in nonhematopoietic cells, and encode a highly hydrophobic, potentially phosphorylated polypeptide of unknown function with significant homology to a putative protein expressed in myeloid cells. The murine E3 promoter harbors a single bipartite retinoic acid response element which in transient transfection assays conferred RA sensitivity.

The P2Y7 receptor mRNA was also abundantly present in the rat heart and cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. The P2Y7 receptor is functionally coupled to phospholipase C in COS-7 cells transiently expressing this receptor. The P2Y7 gene was shown to be localized to human chromosome 14. We have thus cloned a unique member of the P2Y purinoceptor family which probably plays a role in the regulation of cardiac muscle contraction.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, Cell Line, Chromosome Mapping, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14, Cloning, Molecular, DNA Primers, DNA, Complementary, DNA, Neoplasm, Humans, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Myocardium, RNA, Messenger, Rats, Receptors, Purinergic P2, Tissue Distribution, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['U41070']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,U41070

We have examined the action of flt3/flk2 ligand (FL) on physiologic suppression of self-renewal during growth factor-induced differentiation of M1 leukemic cells. Unstimulated M1 cells expressed high levels of flt3 receptor mRNA and protein, with approximately 20,000 molecules present at the cell surface. Consistent with data obtained from normal macrophage populations, expression of both mRNA and protein for flt3 receptor was suppressed as cells were induced to differentiate into mature macrophages in response to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Although FL alone had no detectable action on unstimulated M1 cells, an effect was revealed during LIF-induced differentiation. FL overcame LIF-induced suppression in clonal cultures of M1 cells, prevented morphologic changes associated with macrophage differentiation and interfered with the LIF-induced responsiveness of M1 cells to macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). This action of FL was evident on both parental M1 cells and M1 cells whose differentiation program was perturbed by enforced expression of the transcription factor SCL. The action of FL was most striking in clone transfer experiments in which FL rescued M1 cells from LIF-induced suppression of self-renewal. The ability of FL to maintain self-renewal characteristics satisfies one of the criteria predicted for a stem-cell-active molecule and contrasts with the action of FL in stimulating proliferation and differentiation of normal hematopoietic cells.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Base Sequence, Blotting, Northern, Cell Differentiation, Cell Line, Chlorocebus aethiops, DNA Primers, Fetus, Growth Inhibitors, Hematopoiesis, Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Humans, Interleukin-6, Leukemia Inhibitory Factor, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Liver, Lymphokines, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor, Membrane Proteins, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Polymerase Chain Reaction, RNA, Messenger, Recombinant Proteins, Templates, Genetic, Transfection, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['L23636']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,L23636

The isolated cDNA clone encodes a protein of 246 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 27 991 Da. The protein contains three amino-terminal hydrophobic regions, which could represent transmembrane domains, and a hydrophilic carboxy-terminal region, which we show to be extracellular. The identity of the protein encoded by the cloned cDNA as the 6C6 antigen was confirmed by in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation experiments, and by transfection into cell lines that do not react with the 6C6 mAb, which resulted in the expression of a 28-kDa surface protein that was recognized by the antibody.

A possible mechanistic basis for Mxi1-mediated repression was provided by the recent demonstration that the repressive potential of Mxi1 correlates with its ability to physically associate with mSin3B, one of two mammalian homologues of the yeast transcriptional repressor SIN3. Here, we sought to characterize more fully the physical properties of the second homologue, mSin3A and to determine whether the recruitment of mSin3A by Mxi1 is indeed required for anti-Myc activity. Transient transfection of mammalian cells showed that the mSin3A protein can associate with the strong repressive isoform of Mxi1 (Mxi1-SR) and that, like other Myc superfamily members, both mSin3A and Mxi1-SR localize to the nucleus. From a developmental standpoint, a comparative analysis of Myc, Mxi1-SR and Sin3A expression during postnatal mouse development and in differentiating mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells revealed that dramatic and reciprocal changes in Myc and Mxi1-SR mRNA levels are accompanied by minimal stage-specific changes in mSin3A gene expression. This constant expression profile, coupled with the observation that over-expression of mSin3A does not augment the anti-Myc activity of Mxi1-SR in the rat embryo fibroblast (REF) transformation assay, suggests that mSin3A is not a limiting factor in the regulation of Myc superfamily function. Finally, a mSin3A-Mxi1 fusion protein, in which the amino terminal mSin3-interacting domain of Mxi1-SR was replaced with the full-length mSin3A, exhibited a level of repression activity equivalent to, or greater than, the level of repression obtained with Mxi1-SR. Taken together, these observations directly demonstrate that the amino-terminal repression domain of Mxi1-SR functions solely to recruit mSin3A and possibly other proteins like mSin3A and this association is necessary for the anti-Myc activity of Mxi1-SR.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors, Cell Differentiation, Cell Nucleus, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, DNA-Binding Proteins, Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc, RNA, Messenger, Rats, Repressor Proteins, Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex, Transcription Factors, Transcription, Genetic, Tumor Cells, Cultured, Tumor Suppressor Proteins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['U22394']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,U22394

Three of the peptides, HP-1, HP-2, and HP-3, differ by only one amino acid, and it is thought that HP-2 may represent a proteolytic product of HP-1 and/or HP-3. To help determine the relationship of these three proteins, we isolated a nearly full-length cDNA encoding HP-1 with a sequence very similar to, but different from, the previously isolated HP-1 and -3 cDNAs. Gene copy number experiments established that there were at least two but fewer than five defensin genes with a high level of similarity to the HP-1 cDNA (HP-1/3-like). Three genomic clones were isolated that contained two different configurations of the HP-1/3-like sequences. Sequencing established that one encoded the HP-1 peptide, whereas the other encoded HP-3. Analysis of DNAs obtained from 18 unrelated individuals by Southern blot analysis revealed the expected fragments as well as additional fragments that were not present in the genomic clones. This suggested the possibility of alleles; however, when DNAs from families were examined, these fragments did not segregate in an obvious Mendelian fashion. The HP-1/3-like defensin genes are on human chromosome 8. Surprisingly, somatic cell hybrid mapping showed that the number of HP-1/3-like genes on isolated copies of chromosome 8 was variable. We conclude that individuals can inherit versions of chromosome 8 harboring either two or three copies of the genes that encode the HP-1, HP-2, and/or HP-3 peptides.","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Animals, Base Sequence, Blood Bactericidal Activity, Blood Proteins, Blotting, Southern, Chromosome Mapping, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8, DNA, DNA Primers, Defensins, Exons, Female, Gene Library, Hominidae, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Lymphocytes, Male, Molecular Sequence Data, Neutrophils, Nuclear Family, RNA, Messenger, alpha-Defensins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['X52053']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,X52053

We show that murine PLZF(mPLZF) is expressed at the highest levels in undifferentiated, multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cells and that its expression declines as cells become more mature and committed to various hematopoietic lineages. Data obtained with established cell lines are corroborated by results showing the lack of human PLZF protein expression in mature peripheral blood mononuclear cells and high PLZF levels in the nuclei of CD34+ human bone marrow progenitor cells. Interestingly, unlike many transcription factors, PLZF protein in these cells possesses distinct punctate nuclear distribution, suggesting its compartmentalization in the nucleus.

In these cells, thrombin and U46619 (9,11-dideoxy-9 alpha, 11 alpha-methanoepoxy prostaglandin F2 alpha), a thromboxane A2 analogue, increased intracellular Ca2+ in a rapid and concentration-dependent manner. The peak transient observed with both thrombin and U46619 was preserved upon stimulation in the absence of extracellular calcium and blunted with phorbol myristate acetate, suggestive of activation of phospholipase C. Short-term treatment with leupeptin abolished the calcium response to thrombin, but did not alter that to U46619. Both pertussis toxin (PT) and DMSO pretreatment inhibited thrombin- but not U46619-stimulated intracellular calcium elevation, indicating that these agonists signal through different G-proteins. Western blot analysis of crude membranes from K562 cells revealed the presence of G12 alpha and G13 alpha; the other known PT-substrates, Gi1 alpha and G0 alpha, were not detected. Consistent with this observation, ADP-ribosylation experiments revealed the presence of two PT substrates which co-migrated with human erythrocyte G12 alpha and G13 alpha. An antibody raised against Gq/11 alpha, a subfamily of G-protein alpha subunits unmodified by PT, specifically recognized 42 kDa protein(s) in K562 cells.

Alignment of the deduced protein sequences from Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila pseudoobscura, and Drosophila virilis revealed eight blocks of high sequence homology separated by regions with little or no homology. The largest conserved block contains the Runt domain, a DNA and protein binding domain conserved in a small family of mammalian transcription factors. The functional properties of the Runt domain from the D. melanogaster gene and the human AML1 (acute myeloid leukemia 1) gene were compared in vitro and in vivo. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays with Runt/AML1 chimeras demonstrated that the different DNA binding properties of Runt and AML1 are due to differences within their respective Runt domains.

Thus, although previously shown to be preferentially expressed in T cells and B cells, the phosphatase is also found in mast cells. By immunofluorescence microscopy, rat hematopoietic tyrosine phosphatase localized to discrete, globular compartments within the cytoplasm and was not found either in the nucleus or associated with the cell surface membrane. Aggregation of high affinity IgE receptors in the mast cells induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the phosphatase. The tyrosine phosphorylation was mimicked by stimulation with calcium ionophore A23187 but not by direct activation of protein kinase C.

The longevity of human alpha-globin mRNA is associated with a ribonucleoprotein complex (alpha-complex) formed on the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). One or more of the proteins within this alpha-complex contain strong polycytosine [poly(C)] binding (alpha PCB) activity. In the present report we purify alpha PCB activity from human erythroid K562 cells. Although not able to bind the alpha-globin 3'UTR directly, alpha PCB activity is sufficient to complement alpha-complex formation in a cytosolic extract depleted of poly(C) binding activity. Peptide microsequencing demonstrates that alpha PCB activity contains two structurally related poly(C) binding proteins. These two proteins, alpha-complex protein (alpha CP)-1 and -2, have an overall structural identity of 80% and contain three repeats of the K homology (KH) domain which is found in a subset of RNA binding proteins. Epitope-tagged recombinant alpha CP-1 and alpha CP-2 expressed in cells are each incorporated into the alpha-complex. We conclude that alpha CP-1 and alpha CP-2, members of the KH domain RNA binding protein family, are involved in formation of a sequence-specific alpha-globin mRNP complex associated with alpha-globin mRNA stability. As such this represents the first example of a specific function for this class of proteins and suggests potential roles for other members of this protein family.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Binding Sites, Cell Line, Globins, Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins, Humans, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Open Reading Frames, Poly C, RNA, Messenger, Ribonucleoproteins, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['U24223']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Comparative Study', attributes={'UI': 'D003160'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,U24223

These variant polypeptides differ in sequence only at the N terminus of their cytoplasmic domains. Molecular analyses have shown that transcripts derived from both of the erythroid-specific promoters, P1 and P2, encode all four of these AE1 anion exchanger variants. However, quantitative RNase protection analyses have shown that the transcripts derived from the P1 promoter are much more prevalent than those derived from the P2 promoter. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction studies have indicated that the extensive diversity in the transcripts derived from the AE1 gene occurs both in primitive and definitive lineage erythroid cells. Transient transfection analyses using human erythroleukemia cells have investigated the functional significance of the alternative sequences at the N terminus of these variant exchangers. These studies have shown that the erythroid AE1 variants are sorted to different membrane compartments in these cells. The approximately 99- and approximately 102-kDa variants are primarily sorted to the plasma membrane, whereas the approximately 108-kDa variant is retained in a perinuclear compartment.

The AML1 gene is highly homologous to the Drosophila segmentation gene runt and the mouse transcription factor PEBP2 alpha subunit gene. This region of homology, called the Runt domain, is responsible for DNA-binding and protein--protein interaction. In this study, we isolated and characterized various forms of AML1 cDNAs which reflect a complex pattern of mRNA species. Analysis of these cDNAs has led to the identification of two distinct AML1 proteins, designated AML1b (453 amino acids) and AML1c (480 amino acids), which differ markedly from the previously reported AML1a (250 amino acids) with regard to their C-terminal regions, although all three contain the Runt domain. The large C-terminal region common to AML1b and AML1c is suggested to be a transcriptional activation domain. AML1c differs from AML1b by only 32 amino acids in the N-terminal. Characterization of the genomic structure revealed that the AML1 gene consists of nine exons and spans > 150 kb of genomic DNA. Northern blot analysis demonstrated the presence of six major transcripts, encoding AML1b or AML1c, which can all be explained by the existence of two promoters, alternative splicing and differential usage of three polyadenylation sites. A minor transcript encoding AML1a which results from alternative splicing of a separate exon can be detected only by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction amplification. The distinct proteins encoded by the AML1 gene may have different functions, which could contribute to regulating cell growth and/or differentiation through transcriptional regulation of a specific subset of target genes.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Alternative Splicing, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, Chromosome Mapping, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8, Cloning, Molecular, Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit, DNA, Complementary, DNA, Neoplasm, DNA-Binding Proteins, Exons, Gene Rearrangement, Genome, Humans, Introns, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Neoplasm Proteins, Oncogenes, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, Transcription Factors, Translocation, Genetic",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['D43967', 'D43968', 'D43969']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Comparative Study', attributes={'UI': 'D003160'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,D43967

The deduced amino acid sequence derived from the nucleotide sequence revealed that mouse PPO consists of 477 amino acid residues, without the leader peptide, which is imported into mitochondria. Comparison of the amino terminus of the deduced amino acid sequence of mouse PPO cDNA with that of purified bovine PPO provided conclusive evidence for lack of the leader peptide in the former. The amino acid sequence has 86% and 28% identity with human PPO and Bacillus subtilis HemY, respectively. When mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells were induced with dimethylsulfoxide, PPO mRNA was induced within 12 h of treatment, and with further incubation, reached a plateau. mRNAs for coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO) and ferrochelatase (FEC) were induced within 12 h, and continued to increase with time up to 48 h. The activities of CPO and FEC markedly increased with time up to 72 h, while PPO activity increased 1.8-fold within 12 h and remained unchanged thereafter. Immunoblot analysis showed that levels of PPO, CPO and FEC paralleled their corresponding activities. The magnitude of PPO induction was less than that of CPO and FEC. Thus, induction of three terminal enzymes of the heme-biosynthetic pathway is an early event in MEL cell differentiation. The concomitant induction may play an important role in producing large amounts of heme during erythroid differentiation.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, Cattle, Coproporphyrinogen Oxidase, DNA, Complementary, Enzyme Induction, Erythrocytes, Erythropoiesis, Ferrochelatase, Flavoproteins, Heme, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Mice, Mitochondrial Proteins, Molecular Sequence Data, Oxidoreductases, Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors, Protoporphyrinogen Oxidase, RNA, Messenger, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['D45185']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,D45185

Recently, two genes--AML1, which has a unique runt domain, and ETO (MTG8)--have been isolated from the chromosomal breakpoint. In this study, we isolated and identified two fused transcripts from a leukemic cell line carrying t(8;21). AML1 and ETO were fused at the same position in these transcripts. One of the transcripts codes a unique domain, including two zinc finger domains and three proline- and one leucine-rich region. The other transcript codes only for one proline- and leucine-rich region but lacks zinc finger domains. We demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis that 1) these two transcripts are consistently expressed in leukemic cells with t(8;21) obtained from patients and 2) expression of AML1 was not restricted to the particular stage of hematopoietic differentiation but was present in all hematopoietic cells investigated. We also provide evidence that two wild types of ETO transcripts containing the region of the ETO gene in fused transcripts are expressed in hematopoietic cells from different lineages. The widespread expression of AML1 and ETO in hematopoietic cells suggests a fundamental role of these proteins in hematopoiesis.

Although the MLL gene was alternatively spliced, the fusion protein should contain an N-terminal half of the MLL, including AT hook motifs, that is fused to the MEN protein with a lysine-rich sequence, suggesting that the MLL/MEN fusion protein could be a chimeric transcription factor. The MLL/MEN fusion transcripts of 8.0 kb were detected in leukemic cells of two cases with the translocation. The MLL/MEN fusion was consistent in all three cases of the t(11;19)(q23;p13.1)-carrying leukemia examined by RNA-based polymerase chain reaction.

AML-1 is a site-specific DNA-binding protein that recognizes the enhancer core motif TGTGGT. The t(8;21) translocation fuses the first 177 amino acids of AML-1 to MTG8 (also known as ETO), generating a chimeric protein that retains the DNA-binding domain of AML-1. Analysis of endogenous AML-1 DNA-binding complexes suggested the presence of at least two AML-1 isoforms. Accordingly, we screened a human B-cell cDNA library and isolated a larger, potentially alternatively spliced, form of AML1, termed AML1B. AML-1B is a protein of 53 kDa that binds to a consensus AML-1-binding site and complexes with CBF beta. Subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that both AML-1 and AML-1/ETO are efficiently extracted from the nucleus under ionic conditions but that AML-1B is localized to a salt-resistant nuclear compartment. Analysis of the transcriptional activities of AML-1, AML-1B, and AML-1/ETO demonstrated that only AML-1B activates transcription from the T-cell receptor beta enhancer. Mixing experiments indicated that AML-1/ETO can efficiently block AML-1B-dependent transcriptional activation, suggesting that the t(8;21) translocation creates a dominant interfering protein.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Alternative Splicing, Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Cell Compartmentation, Cell Nucleus, Cloning, Molecular, Consensus Sequence, Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit, Core Binding Factors, DNA, Complementary, DNA-Binding Proteins, Enhancer Elements, Genetic, Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Neoplasm Proteins, Protein Binding, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein, Recombinant Fusion Proteins, Transcription Factors, Transcription, Genetic, Transcriptional Activation",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['U19601']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,U19601

H1 (zero) also accumulates in a variety of cell culture lines undergoing terminal differentiation. During in vitro mouse erythroleukemia cell differentiation, H1 (zero) gene expression is induced very rapidly, prior to the time when the cells actually commit to terminal differentiation. We have used a combination of transfection assays and in vitro DNA-protein interaction studies to identify nuclear protein binding sites in the H1 (zero) promoter that control expression and induction of the H1(zero) gene in mouse erythroleukemia cells. The results indicate that transcription of the H1 (zero) gene is controlled by three elements present in the upstream region of the promoter between positions -305 and -470. Site-directed mutagenesis of each of these elements showed that one of them controls inducibility of the gene in differentiating cells. The other two elements in the upstream control region affect primarily the level of transcription of the gene in undifferentiated and differentiating cells. These two elements share a DNA sequence motif consisting of a (dG)6 tract contained in an eight-base consensus, (A/C)GGGGGG(A/C).

We examined the physiological and molecular properties of this KIR conductance to define the nature of the underlying channel species. The macroscopic conductance revealed characteristics typical of classical K+ inward rectifiers of the IRK type. Channel gating was rapid, first order (tau approximately 1 ms at -100 mV) and steeply voltage dependent. Both activation potential and slope conductance were dependent on extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]o) and inward rectification persisted in the absence of internal Mg2+. The current was susceptible to a concentration- and voltage-dependent block by extracellular Na+, Cs+ and Ba2+. Initial IKIR whole-cell amplitudes as well as current rundown were dependent on the presence of 1 mM internal ATP. Perfusion of intracellular guanosine 5'-Q-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP[gamma S]) suppressed IKIR with an average half-time of decline of approximately 400 s. It was demonstrated that the dominant IRK-type 25 pS conductance channel was indeed suppressed by 100 microM preloaded GTP[gamma S]. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) with RBL cell poly(A)+ RNA identified a full length K+ inward rectifier with 94% base pair homology to the recently cloned mouse IRK1 channel.

The levels of mPLZF mRNAs increased perinatally in the liver, heart, and kidney, but with the exception of the heart, they were either absent or very low in the adult tissues. In situ analysis of mPLZF expression in mouse embryos between 7.0 and 10.5 days of development revealed that mPLZF mRNAs and proteins were coexpressed in spatially restricted and temporally dynamic patterns in the central nervous system. In the hindbrain region, a segmental pattern of expression correlated with the development of the rhombomeres. From 9.0 days of development, starting first in rhombomeres 3 and 5, there was an ordered down-regulation of expression in the center of each rhombomere, so that 1 day later elevated levels of mPLZF mRNAs and proteins were restricted to cells surrounding the rhombomeric boundaries. The chicken homologue of the PLZF gene, which we have also cloned, demonstrated a similar segmental pattern of expression in the hindbrain. To date, PLZF represents the only example of a transcription factor with elevated expression at rhombomeric boundaries. The high degree of evolutionary conservation between the patterns of PLZF expression during mammalian and avian central nervous system development suggests that it has an important functional role in the regionalization of the vertebrate hindbrain, potentially regulating boundary cell interactions.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Central Nervous System, Chickens, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17, DNA-Binding Proteins, Embryo, Mammalian, Embryo, Nonmammalian, Embryonic and Fetal Development, Humans, Immunohistochemistry, Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Myocardium, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein, Rhombencephalon, Transcription Factors, Translocation, Genetic, Zinc Fingers",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['Z47205', 'Z47206']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,Z47205

MBP is stored in eosinophil crystalloid granules and released with other granule constituents during eosinophil action. Previous studies have identified an MBP gene promoter that generates a 1.0 kb mRNA transcript encoding MBP preproprotein which undergoes processing to the mature storage form. To investigate how the MBP gene is regulated, we have examined the identity and levels of the MBP transcripts both in precursor cells and in blood eosinophils. It was found that the gene was expressed from two upstream promoters, a distal promoter P1 in addition to the previously described promoter P2. Evidence for the second promoter was initially provided by isolation from a human HL-60 leukaemic cell cDNA library of a novel 1.6 kb MBP cDNA that was distinct from the known 1.0 kb cDNA. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 1.6 kb cDNA was determined, and showed that the two cDNAs had identical coding and 3' untranslated regions but differed in their 5' sequences. By isolating and sequencing MBP genomic clones from an arrayed chromosome 11 library, it was demonstrated that the MBP gene is composed of nine upstream exons and five coding exons. The 1.6 and 1.0 kb cDNAs arise by differential splicing of alternate MBP transcripts from promoters P1 and P2 respectively, located 32 kb apart in the genomic DNA. Primer extension analysis identified two transcription start sites at P1, neither associated with a typical TATA box motif. Northern blotting and reverse-transcription PCR analysis showed that the 1.0 kb mRNA was present at higher levels than the 1.6 kb species in immature cells including HL-60 and bone-marrow cells. By contrast, low levels of 1.6 kb mRNA transcripts predominated in differentiated blood eosinophils. The results are compatible with differential use of P1 and P2 promoters as a mechanism for regulation of MBP expression during eosinophil maturation.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Alternative Splicing, Base Sequence, Blood Proteins, Blotting, Northern, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11, DNA, Complementary, Eosinophil Granule Proteins, Eosinophils, Exons, Humans, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Promoter Regions, Genetic, RNA, Messenger, RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, Ribonucleases, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Transcription, Genetic, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['Z26248']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,Z26248

There were identical stretches of one to seven nucleotides between the PML and RARA genes in the majority of the joining sequences. These data provide a potential model of the t(15;17) translocation: random DNA double strand cleavage, modification of DNA ends by enzymes including terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and single strand base-pairing within identical short stretches.

Molecular cytogenetic analysis and cloning of a few t(3;21) cases indicate that the breakpoints are quite heterogeneous even within a specific clinical phenotype. Interestingly some of the (3;21) breakpoints involve the AML1 gene previously found rearranged in the t(8;21) associated with acute myelogenous leukemia. AML1 is related to the Drosophila gene runt and is the human counterpart of the gene for the alpha subunit of the nuclear polyoma enhancer binding protein (PEBP2) also known as the core binding factor (CBF). In the t(3;21) AML1 was found rearranged with EAP, a gene on chromosome 3 encoding a small ribosomal protein, as well as with EV11, another gene on chromosome 3. Here we report our study of six cases of t(3;21). By using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and AML1 probes we could conclude that at least in two CML-BC cases the breakpoint occurred in the AML1 intron that is disrupted by the t(8;21). An AML1/EAP fusion transcript, different from the one described in a therapy-related myelodysplasia, was detected in both CML-BC cases. This transcript is expected to result in a predicted protein containing the AML1 nuclear binding domain with an attached stretch of 17 amino acids unrelated to the EAP small ribosomal protein. In the other t(3;21) patients we could not detect an AML1/EAP transcript or an AML1/EV11 transcript. This result suggests heterogeneity of the t(3;21) at the molecular level. The AML1 chimeric transcripts identified so far, both in the t(3;21) and in the t(8;21), diverge from the normal transcripts either after exon 5 or exon 6.

One of the cDNAs isolated contained an additional six nucleotides close to the N-terminus, lying in-frame and at a point corresponding to an intron/exon boundary in the human annexin II gene. As the two rat cDNAs were identical apart from the six nucleotide insert, it is likely that these represent alternatively spliced transcripts of a single gene, rather than the products of two separate genes.

Recent studies suggest that this gene may play an important role in a new form of cell resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents. To examine mechanisms regulating transcriptional activity of this gene, a 2.2-kilobase 5'-flanking sequence of MRP has been isolated from a genomic library prepared from HL60/ADR cells. The 2.2-kilobase DNA fragment linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene in a reporter plasmid was found to be capable of driving expression of this gene in transient transfection experiments. This DNA containing promoter activity has been sequenced in its entirety and found to contain multiple putative regulatory sites. A series of deletion mutants linked to the CAT reporter gene was used to examine functional domains of the 2.2-kilobase sequence. The results suggest that promoter activity is contained in nucleotides -91 to +103 in a GC-rich region of the MRP genome. Promoter activity contained within this sequence, however, is modulated by both positive and negative regulatory elements. Certain of the regulatory sites contain consensus sequences for positive and negative regulatory elements which have been found in the promoter regions of other genes. Primer extension analysis indicates the presence of multiple major transcriptional start sites from the MRP promoter. Sequence analysis of MRP genomic and complementary DNAs has defined the exon/intron boundaries and the organization of a portion of the 5'-end region of the MRP genome. The results of these studies thus provide new insight in site-specific domains which may function in the regulation of MRP gene expression.","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Base Sequence, Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase, Cloning, Molecular, Doxorubicin, Drug Resistance, Exons, Gene Deletion, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Humans, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['U07050']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,U07050

In order to define the regions important for transcriptional regulation of the mouse ferritin H gene, we have linked the promoter, including the transcription start site, and 5 kilobases of upstream sequence to a reporter gene (human growth hormone). This construct and a series of 5' deletion mutants have been used to transfect erythroid (K562, mouse erythroleukemia (MEL)) and hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines. Measurement of growth hormone in the culture medium and analysis of ferritin-growth hormone transcripts by a ribonuclease protection assay revealed that a 140-base pair minimal promoter is sufficient to confer a high level of expression to the reporter gene in both cell types. In addition, a 180-base pair fragment, lying 4.5 kilobases upstream of the ferritin transcription start site, functions like an inducible enhancer during N,N'-hexamethylene-bis-acetamide-induced differentiation of MEL cells. A perfect match to a consensus binding motif to the erythroid transcription factor NF-E2 is present in this regulatory element, but the mutant NF-E2 enhancer retains the inducible activity in stably transfected MEL cells, and the results from gel retardation assays suggest that protein-DNA complexes that form in vitro between the ferritin enhancer and MEL nuclear extracts do not contain NF-E2.

It also contains elements which direct the markedly increased expression observed following megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells with phorbol dibutyrate. Analysis of hybrid alpha IIb-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs indicates that at least three regions within the -598 to +32 region control differentiation-dependent alpha IIb transcription. Two enhancer elements as well as a silencer domain all regulate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transcriptional activity in K562 cells. Gel mobility shift experiments revealed that nuclear binding proteins are able to interact with all three DNA regions. A small region lying between -124 and -99 bases is able to bind to nuclear proteins in undifferentiated cells but not in differentiated cells as evidenced by gel mobility shift and foot-printing studies and corresponds to the silencer element identified in the functional studies.

(1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88: 10671-10675]. In this approach, T4 RNA ligase is used to join cellular RNA with a defined ribo-oligonucleotide. Although several additional enzymatic steps are involved in this type of analysis, the reliability of the entire procedure is determined by the initial ligation step, which marks and preserves the termini of cellular RNA molecules. We applied this approach to the analysis of the 5' terminus of beta globin mRNA in various murine erythroid cells. As expected, we detected RNA molecules with 5' ends terminating at the regular cap site as well as globin RNA molecules truncated at the 5' end. Unexpectedly, we also detected a class of beta globin mRNA which is identical to regular beta globin mRNA in every respect but contains 17, 29, or 31 additional nucleotides 5' to the regular cap site. These extensions correspond precisely to the genomic segments just upstream of the regular cap site and are probably generated by initiation of transcription of the globin gene upstream from the regular cap site. It is likely that the extended globin RNA is transcribed not from the TATA promoter, which regulates the transcription of regular murine globin mRNA, but from the GATA regulatory element located 30 nucleotides upstream of the 31-nucleotide extension, in a position identical to that of the active GATA promoter of the TATA-less chicken beta globin gene.

While the GPB gene produces one transcript, the GPA gene produces three or four transcripts of different sizes. To understand the mechanisms of production of the different transcripts and erythroid-specific expression, we characterized the transcripts and the transcriptional regulatory regions of the glycophorin A gene. The transcriptional start site was determined by primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analysis, and it was found that all of the transcripts start at one major site. The nucleotide sequence of the newly isolated longest GPA cDNA revealed several polyadenylation signal sequences. To determine which polyadenylation signals are utilized, cDNA clones encoding GPA were isolated from a cDNA library of human erythroleukemia cell line K562 and the 3'-regions of the cDNAs were specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. These results showed that five different polyadenylation signals of the GPA gene are utilized and the size and abundance of the transcripts are consistent with those detected by Northern blot analysis of K562 mRNAs. The 5'-flanking sequence was found to contain several binding motifs for the transcription factors, which were also found in other erythroid-specific genes. These motifs include the binding sites for the GATA-1 and NF-E2 erythroid-specific transcription factors, in addition to Sp1 transcription factor. The 5'-sequence from -750 to +36 relative to the transcriptional start site could confer only a low basal transcriptional activity in K562 cells and Friend erythroleukemia cells. This activity was significantly increased after Friend erythroleukemia cells were differentiated by dimethylsulfoxide.

The final step in sialyl Lewis x synthesis is catalyzed by alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferases acting on sialylated glycoconjugate precursors. Cultured human leukocytic cell lines express an alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase gene termed Fuc-TIV or ELFT but do not express the other three cloned human alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase genes to any significant degree. The physiological role of Fuc-TIV/ELFT in sialyl Lewis x biosynthesis is uncertain, however, since it can catalyze the synthesis of this determinant in some, but not all, transfected cell lines in a manner that is dependent upon the glycosylation phenotype of the host cell. We report here the molecular cloning of a cDNA encoding a new human leukocyte alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase, termed Fuc-TVII, capable of synthesizing the sialyl Lewis x moiety. The cDNA sequence predicts a 341-amino acid-long type II transmembrane protein typical of mammalian glycosyltransferases. When expressed in mammalian cells, the Fuc-TVII cDNA directs the synthesis of cell surface sialyl Lewis x moieties but not the Lewis x, Lewis a, sialyl Lewis a, or VIM-2 determinants. Fuc-TVII can efficiently utilize alpha-2,3-sialyllactosamine in vitro to form the sialyl Lewis x tetrasaccharide but does not utilize lactosamine to form the Lewis x moiety. Northern blot analyses show that the Fuc-TVII gene is transcribed in HL-60 cells, a human promyelocytic cell line, and in YT cells, a natural killer-like cell line. Fuc-TVII represents a leukocytic alpha-1,3-fucosyltransferase that can participate in selectin ligand synthesis via its ability to catalyze the synthesis of sialyl Lewis x determinants.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, CHO Cells, Carbohydrate Sequence, Cell Line, Chlorocebus aethiops, Chromosome Mapping, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11, Cloning, Molecular, Cricetinae, DNA, DNA Primers, DNA, Complementary, Fucosyltransferases, Humans, Killer Cells, Natural, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Leukocytes, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Oligosaccharides, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Protein Structure, Secondary, Recombinant Proteins, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Sialyl Lewis X Antigen, Substrate Specificity, Transfection, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['U08112']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Comparative Study', attributes={'UI': 'D003160'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,U08112

Recent genomic sequence analysis of a 90 kb segment of DNA containing the tumour necrosis factor genes in the class III region of the MHC has predicted the presence of three potential exons mapping between the BAT1 and TNFB genes (12). A near full-length cDNA clone corresponding to a novel gene located between BAT1 and TNFB that contains sequence corresponding to one of these putative exons, has been isolated from a premonocytic leukaemic cell line cDNA library. Characterization of this gene reveals that it spans 13.5 kb of DNA, with the 3' end of the gene lying approximately 12 kb from the 5' end of the TNFB gene. The cDNA hybridizes to a approximately 1.6 kb mRNA in a number of different cell types, including monocytes, T cells, B cells and hepatocytes. The putative polypeptide encoded by this cDNA is 381 amino acids in length, with a non-glycosylated M(r) of 43214. It contains one partial and two full ANK repeats, which bear a marked similarity to those in the I kappa B family of proteins, suggesting that the protein encoded by the novel gene could represent a divergent member of this family.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Consensus Sequence, DNA, Complementary, DNA, Neoplasm, Genes, Humans, Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains, Leucine Zippers, Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute, Major Histocompatibility Complex, Molecular Sequence Data, Multigene Family, Sequence Alignment, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['X77909']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Comparative Study', attributes={'UI': 'D003160'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,X77909

We studied the expression of the two type II activin receptor mRNAs during the differentiation of K562 erythroleukemic cells, which are known to be induced toward the erythroid lineage in response to activin or toward the megakaryoblastic lineage by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The cDNA of the human activin receptor type IIB (hActR-IIB) was cloned and sequenced from two RNA sources, the K562 cells and the human fetal brain, which is, of the tissues screened by Northern blot analysis, the most abundant source of ActR-IIB RNA. The cDNA encodes a predicted 512 amino acid protein containing an extracellular ligand binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain.

The alternative splicing events in the juxtamembrane region previously reported for the respective mouse receptor were not observed during the processing of K562 cell and human fetal brain RNA. Northern analysis showed that the 10- and 2.5-kb transcripts of hActR-IIB are more abundantly expressed than the 6.0- and 3.0-kb transcripts of hActR-II in K562 cells. No changes in the steady-state levels of hActR-II and IIB mRNAs were detected upon differentiation of K562 cells by activin A or by PMA.

Recently, the AML1 portion of the fusion protein has been shown to correspond to the DNA-binding and dimerization domains of the mouse gene, polyoma enhancer binding protein 2 alpha B (pebp 2 alpha B). We report here the complete sequence of the ETO portion of the fusion transcript as compiled from complementary DNAs from a t(8;21) AML patient and compare this with the ETO sequence from a mouse brain transcript. The deduced amino acid sequences are 99% identical. ETO has several features consistent with it being a transcription factor. The ETO sequence is different from the portion of PEBP 2 alpha B it replaces in the AML1/ETO fusion protein, except for their common high content of proline, serine, and threonine residues. Because neither the putative zinc fingers nor the TAF110 homology domain of ETO is present in PEBP2 alpha B, one might expect functional differences in the ability of AML1/ETO protein to affect the levels of transcription of genes normally regulated to some degree by AML1 (PEBP2 alpha B) during myeloid differentiation.

Sequence analysis revealed that PBR/IBP comprises 169 amino acid residues (M(r) 18,828), and has a high homology with PBR/IBP from other sources. The cDNA allows for the expression of active PBR/IBP, exhibiting a high affinity for isoquinoline carboxamide, [3H]PK11195, with Kd of 0.80 and 1.56 nM. RNA blot analysis revealed that treatment of MEL cells with dimethyl sulfoxide led to an increase in PBR/IBP mRNA (delta 1.0 kilobases) for up to 72 h, with a concomitant induction of mRNAs for heme biosynthetic enzymes, coproporphyrinogen oxidase and ferrochelatase. The induction of PBR/IBP mRNA was also observed in MEL cells induced with diazepam.

The order of potency of different ligands to compete against [3H]PK11195 binding in induced MEL cells was PK11195 > protoporphyrin IX > diazepam > coproporphyrinogen III > coproporphyrin III > estazolam. In contrast to the induction of PBR/IBP in induced MEL cells, the voltage-dependent anion channel (mitochondrial porin) associated with PBR remained unchanged.

Although the limits of these deletions vary among patients, a region of cytogenetic overlap that includes band 5q31 is deleted consistently, suggesting loss of 5q31 loci critical for normal myeloid differentiation and leukemogenesis. An anonymous genomic DNA segment D5S89, previously mapped to 5q21-31, detects consistent loss of alleles in cases showing the 5q- chromosome at presentation or relapse. Analysis of a panel of natural-deletion somatic-cell hybrids in conjunction with irradiation hybrids containing fragments of human chromosome 5q shows that the D5S89 locus is telomeric to the interleukin (IL) genes (IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) and interferon response factor-1 (IRF-1) gene and centromeric to the early response transcription factor (early growth response gene-1 [EGR-1]) on 5q31. To further define the principal region of loss, we have isolated and characterized yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) spanning D5S89. The presence of several CpG islands within the 300-kb YAC is suggestive of multiple transcription units. However, IL-4, IL-5, IRF-1, IL-3, GM-CSF, and EGR-1 genes were not detected in the YAC clone spanning D5S89, implying that none of these genes are in the vicinity of the D5S89 marker. Further characterization of these YACs should facilitate the isolation of novel candidate genes that may play a role in the evolution of the abnormal phenotype associated with 5q- chromosome.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Base Sequence, Chromosome Deletion, Chromosome Mapping, Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5, DNA-Binding Proteins, Early Growth Response Protein 1, Female, Humans, Immediate-Early Proteins, Interleukins, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Male, Molecular Sequence Data, Multigene Family, Polymorphism, Genetic, Transcription Factors",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['S67780']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,S67780

The genes fall into two classes that are distinguished by their dependence on protein synthesis for the induction by serum, i.e., primary and secondary genes. While 11 of these genes encode known proteins, 4 other genes have not been described to date. The former genes encode proteins of diverse functions, including the monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor (MONAP), calmodulin, tropomyosin, tenascin, collagenase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-2a, the 'sperm-specific' cleavage signal-1 protein, metallothionein IIa and the mitochondrial chaperonin hsp-60. Interestingly, one of the unknown genes contains a large open reading frame for a polypeptide that is highly homologous to a previously unidentified long open reading frame in the opposite strand of the gene coding for the transcription factor HTF-4. We also studied the regulation of these serum-induced genes during cell cycle progression in normally cycling WI-38 and HL-60 cells separated by counterflow elutriation as well as in serum-stimulated HL-60 cells. Our results clearly show that, in contrast to the prevailing opinion, the expression of most genes induced after mitogen stimulation is not subject to a significant regulation in normally proliferating cells.

In this study, we cloned cDNAs synthesized from a cell line carrying t(8;21) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using an AML1-specific primer. The analysis of the cDNAs structure has led to the identification of the fusion of AML1 with a gene named MTG8 on chromosome 8, which seems to be identical to ETO. Northern analysis using MTG8 (ETO) probes detected 7.8-kb and 6.2-kb RNAs and several minor RNAs in the cell line with t(8;21), but failed to detect any transcripts in a cell line without t(8;21). A set of primers were designed to detect the AML1/MTG8(ETO) fusion by PCR. The PCR amplified identical products in all 6 patients and one cell line with t(8;21), suggesting that the AML1/MTG8(ETO) fusion is a constant feature associated with t(8;21) and the junctions of the AML1/MTG8(ETO) fusion are restricted in a unique site. Because the PCR detection of the AML1/MTG8(ETO) fusion at the RNA level is highly sensitive, it can be used as a sensitive method for diagnosis and detection of minimal residual disease in t(8;21) leukemia.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8, Cloning, Molecular, Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit, DNA-Binding Proteins, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Neoplasm Proteins, Oncogenes, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein, Transcription Factors, Translocation, Genetic",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['D14822', 'D14823']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,D14822

The leukemic cells from six patients with acute myelogenous leukemia were separated from heparinized whole blood and bone marrow by a density gradient technique. The expression of RAS oncogenes was analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorting with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The high expression of DWP, which was reported to recognized activated RAS oncogene, was found in two patients and was associated with high levels of H-RAS expression. These facts prompted us to analyze the DNA sequence of RAS genes with an automated DNA sequencer. Unexpectedly, various kinds of H-RAS point mutations were found in all six cases, including two cases of hot-spot point mutation at codon 12, whereas K-RAS point mutation (no hot-spot point mutations) was found in six cases. The same H-RAS point mutations, at codons 10, 11, and 15, were found in all six cases. To our knowledge, there is no report on H-RAS point mutation in human leukemias.

This cDNA corresponds to a gene constitutively expressed in most human cells which is induced to higher levels upon serum stimulation in untransformed and ras-transformed HBL100 cells. However, the abundance of the pag transcript is approximately 3-fold higher in transformed as compared to untransformed cells after 7-15 h of serum stimulation. In the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 induced to differentiate the level of pag mRNA starts to decrease between 48 and 72 h following induction. During this period, which represents the commitment phase of differentiation, HL60 cells cease to proliferate. Therefore, in HBL100 and HL60 cells, higher levels of pag gene expression are correlated with cell proliferation. The pag cDNA codes for a 22-kDa protein, devoid of known consensus motifs, and shares 66% homology with a murine gene product (MER5) that is preferentially expressed in erythroleukemia cells during the early period of cell differentiation. In addition, the pag gene product shares approximately 50% identity with a 29-kDa surface antigen of Entamoeba histolytica and a 26-kDa antigen of Helicobacter pylori. Distant relationship was also found with other prokaryotic proteins. The pag cDNA hybridizes to multiple sequences within human and other mammalian genomes and to fewer sequences in chicken and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Although a true relationship between eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes is difficult to establish, the conservation of pag gene sequences throughout Eukaryotae rather suggests that the pag locus belongs to a new class of genes encoding highly conserved proteins.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Amino Acid Sequence, Bacterial Proteins, Base Sequence, Breast, Cell Differentiation, Cell Division, Cell Line, Transformed, Cloning, Molecular, DNA, Epithelium, Female, Gene Expression, Gene Library, Genes, ras, Heat-Shock Proteins, Humans, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Peroxidases, Peroxiredoxins, Protein Biosynthesis, Proteins, Protozoan Proteins, RNA, Messenger, Recombinant Proteins, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Transfection, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['X67951']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Comparative Study', attributes={'UI': 'D003160'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,X67951

The complete cDNA sequence is predicted to encode a protein of approximately 38,000 Da that contains a proline-rich amino domain and three TFIIIA-like zinc fingers within the carboxy domain. Additional sequence analyses reveal that the EKLF zinc fingers are most homologous to the Krüppel family of transcription factors and also allow us to predict potential DNA-binding target sites for the EKLF protein. On the basis of this prediction, we show that EKLF is able to bind the sequence CCA CAC CCT, an essential element of the beta-globin promoter. Its tissue distribution establishes that the EKLF transcript is expressed only in bone marrow and spleen, the two hematopoietic organs of the mouse, and analysis of murine cell lines indicates that EKLF expression is limited to erythroid and mast cell lines. Cotransfection assays establish that EKLF transcriptionally activates a target promoter that contains its DNA-binding site. The tissue expression pattern of EKLF, in conjunction with its function as a transcriptional activator, strongly suggests that the EKLF protein may be intimately involved in establishment and/or maintenance of the erythroid cell phenotype.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, Blotting, Northern, Cell Line, Chromosome Mapping, Cricetinae, DNA-Binding Proteins, Hybrid Cells, Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Macrophages, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Nuclear Proteins, Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Oligonucleotides, Antisense, Polymerase Chain Reaction, RNA, Repressor Proteins, Sequence Homology, Amino Acid, Substrate Specificity, Transcription Factors, Tumor Cells, Cultured, Zinc Fingers",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['M97200']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Comparative Study', attributes={'UI': 'D003160'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,M97200

Attempts to determine a functional significance to this diversity is hindered by a paucity of primary amino acid sequence data. Although numerous H1 genes have been cloned, the type of variant they encode cannot be determined by sequence analysis alone. We used transformation and overexpression methods to determine that two cloned mouse H1 genes, MH143 and MH175, encode H1c and H1e, respectively. Since these genes have been completely sequenced, these results establish the amino acid sequence of these variants. Assignment was accomplished by mutagenically ""tagging"" the genes by incorporation of a codon for methionine, which is not found in the major somatic H1 variants. These genes were placed under the control of the mouse metallothionein I promoter and introduced into 3T3 cells. Products of these mutagenized genes were detected by [35S]methionine labeling and identified by high performance liquid chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We were also able to induce major alterations in the normal stoichiometry of chromatin-associated H1 variants through overproduction of H1c and H1e.

In cells permeabilized with digitonin, uptake was ATP dependent with an apparent Km of 1.3 microM. Uptake was abolished by the proton-translocating ionophore carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone and with tri-(n-butyl)tin, an inhibitor of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase.

The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited 98% identity to the human cellular transglutaminase sequence. The cysteine at position 277 in the active site and the putative Ca(2+)-binding pocket at residues 446-453 of cellular transglutaminase are conserved. Such evidence predicts that the encoded protein product is likely to be a transglutaminase homologue (TGase-H).

We identified two types of HisDC cDNA, representing the 2.4-kb and 3.4-kb HisDC mRNA constitutively expressed in these cells.

A rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cell cDNA library was screened with a 500-base pair (bp) sequence from the human thrombin receptor, obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of cDNA synthesized from human erythropoietic leukemia (HEL) cell mRNA with PCR primers based on the published human thrombin receptor sequence. Clone pRTHR17 contains a 3418-bp insert that includes 50 bp of the 5'-untranslated region and the entire coding and 3'-untranslated regions of the RASM cell thrombin receptor. The sequence of pRTHR17 is 85% similar, at the nucleotide level, and 78% similar, at the deduced amino acid level, to the human thrombin receptor. Although the putative thrombin cleavage and binding sites are present, there are significant differences between the rat and human receptors in their amino-terminal sequences. Detectable signals (consisting of a single band of 3.45 kb) are present by Northern analysis of mRNA from RASM cells, and rat lung, kidney, and testes, but not in aorta or other tissues probed. The results of Southern analysis of rat genomic DNA are consistent with the existence of a single copy of the gene encoding this receptor. The steady state thrombin receptor mRNA level is low in cultured growth-arrested RASM cells and not detectable in rat aorta. To determine whether regulation of the RASM cell thrombin receptor occurs under growth-stimulating conditions, growth-arrested RASM cells were treated with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, recently proposed to be a major mitogen controlling vascular smooth muscle cell growth following injury (Lindner, V., and Reidy, M.

The data were consistent with two tandemly arranged transcription units, the 3' end of one separated from the 5' end of the other by a sequence of about 600 bp containing an active promoter. The isolation and sequencing of L30E-specific cDNAs permitted identification of two genes, one of which encoded a B-type human lamin (analogous to mouse lamin B2). L30E DNA was mapped by in situ hybridization at the G-negative subtelomeric band p13.3 of chromosome 19. Interestingly, in synchronized HL-60 cells, L30E DNA is replicated in the first minute of S-phase.

The exons, intron 1, and intron 2 comprised 7, 53, and 40% of the gene, respectively. Nineteen Alu-repetitive DNA sequences were interspersed in the gene, accounting for 28% of the total nucleotides in intron 1 and 40% of the nucleotides in intron 2. The nucleotide sequence was then used in an examination of the methylation pattern of the human serglycin gene in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells that contain serglycin mRNA and in T-lymphoblast Molt-4 cells that do not. With polymerase chain reaction methodology, 13 DNA probes of 250-880 base pairs in length were generated that corresponded to unique, non-Alu sequences spaced throughout the entire human serglycin gene. When blots containing genomic DNA digested with HpaII or MspI were examined with these genomic probes, it was discovered that the 5'-flanking region and intron 1 of the serglycin gene in HL-60 cells were both substantially less methylated than intron 2. In contrast, the entire serglycin gene in Molt-4 cells was highly methylated. Because hypomethylated genes generally are transcribed more efficiently than hypermethylated genes, the high level of serglycin mRNA in HL-60 cells probably is a consequence of the low level of methylation of intron 1 and the 5'-flanking region of the serglycin gene in these cells.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S., Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Base Sequence, Blotting, Northern, Blotting, Southern, Cell Line, DNA, Humans, Introns, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Methylation, Molecular Sequence Data, Proteoglycans, RNA, T-Lymphocytes, Tumor Cells, Cultured, Vesicular Transport Proteins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['M63383', 'M86615', 'M86616', 'M86617', 'M86618', 'M86619', 'M86620', 'M90058', 'M90360', 'X62322']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013486'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,M63383

In contrast to cromoglycate itself, which is membrane impermeant and ineffective in these cells, its bis-acetoxymethyl ester derivative (CG/AM) can diffuse across the plasma membrane into the cytosol, where it is hydrolyzed into the impermeant CG dianion, which presumably may interact with intracellular components involved in the Fc epsilon R signal transduction pathway.

Unlike viruses in the Friend virus complex, it does not cause erythroleukemia but causes a rapidly progressive hind limb paralysis when injected into newborn rats and mice. We have isolated an infectious DNA clone (clone 3d) of this virus which causes neurological disease in animals as efficiently as parental PVC-211 MuLV. The restriction map of clone 3d is very similar to that of the nonneuropathogenic, erythroleukemogenic Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV), suggesting that PVC-211 MuLV is a variant of F-MuLV and that no major structural alteration was involved in its derivation. Studies with chimeric viruses between PVC-211 MuLV clone 3d and wild-type F-MuLV clone 57 indicate that at least one determinant for neuropathogenicity resides in the 2.1-kb XbaI-ClaI fragment containing the gp70 coding region of PVC-211 MuLV. Compared with nonneuropathogenic ecotropic MuLVs, the env gene of PVC-211 MuLV encodes four unique amino acids in the gp70 protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis also revealed a deletion in the U3 region of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of PVC-211 MuLV clone 3d compared with F-MuLV clone 57. In contrast to the env gene of PVC-211 MuLV, particular sequences within the U3 region of the viral LTR do not appear to be required for neuropathogenicity. However, the changes in the LTR of PVC-211 MuLV may be responsible for the failure of this virus to cause erythroleukemia, because chimeric viruses containing the U3 region of F-MuLV clone 57 were erythroleukemogenic whereas those with the U3 of PVC-211 MuLV clone 3d were not.",Journal Article,"3T3 Cells, Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Animals, Newborn, Base Sequence, Cloning, Molecular, Friend murine leukemia virus, Genes, env, Genetic Variation, Genome, Viral, Hindlimb, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Leukemia, Experimental, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Paralysis, Protein Processing, Post-Translational, Rats, Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid, Restriction Mapping, Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid, Tumor Cells, Cultured, Viral Proteins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['M81185']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'})]",GENBANK,M81185

To identify genes that may be aberrantly expressed in APL, a subtraction cDNA library of an APL patient with t(15;17) was constructed. A cDNA, pRD1, specifically expressed in APL was identified. DNA sequence analysis of pRD1 showed that this gene is similar to the DNA sequence of annexin VIII, a gene which encodes a vascular anticoagulant. The annexin VIII gene was assigned to chromosome 10, which indicates that specific expression of this gene in APL is not directly involved in the t(15;17) breakpoint region. We have analyzed the expression of annexin VIII gene in nine t(15;17)-positive APL patients and one APL patient with a chromosome 17q-abnormality. We found that all APL samples expressed high levels of the annexin VIII gene. Expression of the annexin VIII gene in all other leukemias, including acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was undetectable, except in one patient with acute myelogenous leukemia in which a very low level of expression was detected. Annexin VIII is highly expressed in the APL cell line, NB4. Its expression was significantly reduced after 8 hours of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment, whereas the expression of RARA increased several-fold within 4 hours postinduction. Thus, increased expression of RARA preceded the downregulation of annexin VIII after ATRA induction, suggesting an inverse relationship between RARA and annexin VIII expression. Since increased expression of the fusion transcript was seen after ATRA induction and an APL without a t(15;17) translocation expressed high levels of annexin VIII, it appears that increased expression of annexin VIII in APL is not related to the fusion transcript. Therefore, dysregulation of the RARA gene may be related to the overexpression of annexin VIII in APL.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Annexins, Base Sequence, Blotting, Northern, Blotting, Southern, Carrier Proteins, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17, DNA, Neoplasm, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Humans, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Peptides, Receptors, Retinoic Acid, Translocation, Genetic, Tretinoin, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['L12691', 'M80678', 'M80679', 'M81844', 'M91429', 'M91430', 'M93301', 'X64637', 'X64638', 'X64639']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,L12691

We performed metabolic labeling studies of defensin synthesis in the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 and in chronic myeloid leukemia cells, and showed that preprodefensins are processed to mature 29 to 30 aa defensins over 4 to 24 hours via two major intermediates: a 75 aa prodefensin generated by the cleavage of the signal sequence, and a 56 aa prodefensin that results from a subsequent preaspartate proteolytic cleavage. Almost all of the 75 aa form was found in the cytoplasmic/microsomal fraction, whereas the 56 aa prodefensin and mature defensins predominated in the granule-enriched fraction. The 75 aa prodefensin was also selectively released into the culture supernatant. Treatment of HL-60 cells with monensin, chloroquine, or ammonium chloride, substances that neutralize acidic subcellular compartments, partially blocked conversion of the 75 aa prodefensin into 56 aa prodefensin, but did not increase the extracellular release of the 75 aa form. Further studies will be required to determine the role of this processing pathway in subcellular targeting to azurophil granules and avoidance of autocytotoxicity.","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Blood Proteins, Defensins, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Molecular Weight, Monensin, Neutrophils, Peroxidase, Protein Precursors, Protein Processing, Post-Translational, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['L12690', 'L12691', 'M80678', 'M80679', 'M91429', 'M91430', 'M93301', 'X64637', 'X64638', 'X64639']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,L12690

We report here the characterization of Myl and of the reciprocal MylRAR (PMLRAR) and RARMyl (RARPML) fusion transcripts which are found in two classes of APL patients. Myl displays similarities with a new family of proteins of which some members are fused to protooncogenes in the transforming proteins RFP-ret and T18. The speckled nuclear localization of Myl, as well as its sequence homology with the 52 kDa component of the RO/SSA ribonucleoprotein particle, suggest that Myl may be present in a ribonucleoprotein complex. In contrast to both Myl and RAR-alpha whose localization is essentially nuclear in the presence or absence of RA, MylRAR which is largely cytoplasmic in the absence of RA appears to be translocated to the nucleus in the presence of RA. Myl and MylRAR can associate in vitro and this association is mediated by a coiled coil in the Myl sequence. In vivo this association results in a colocalization of Myl and MylRAR which is identical to that of MylRAR alone. Studies of activation of transcription from the promoters of several RA target genes indicate that MylRARs have altered transcription activation properties when compared with RAR-alpha. Most notably, MylRAR represses markedly the activity of some RA target promoters in the absence of RA. Western blot analyses of patient samples show that MylRAR is expressed to a much higher level than wild type RAR-alpha originating from the normal allele. Taken together, these results suggest that MylRAR may interfere in a dominant manner with both Myl and RAR functions.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Alleles, Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Carrier Proteins, Cell Line, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15, Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17, Humans, Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Oligonucleotide Probes, Oncogene Proteins, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Receptors, Retinoic Acid, Recombinant Fusion Proteins, Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid, Transcription, Genetic, Transfection, Translocation, Genetic, Tretinoin",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['D13200', 'D13201', 'D13202', 'D13203', 'L07339', 'M94783', 'M94784', 'M94785', 'X63131', 'X63350']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Comparative Study', attributes={'UI': 'D003160'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,D13200

Most of these breakpoints occur within the second intron of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARA) gene. We screened a cDNA library of APL and have identified and sequenced a cDNA transcribed from the t(15;17) translocation breakpoint. The 5' end of cDNA p1715 consists of 503 bp of the RARA exon II sequence. A 1.76-kb cDNA without homology to any known gene available in GenBank was found truncated downstream. This cDNA sequence was assigned to chromosome 15 by dot blot hybridization of the flow cytometry-sorted chromosomes. We designate this fusion cDNA RARA/myl, which is different from myl/RARA reported by de The et al. (H. de The, C. Chomienne, M. Lanotte, L. Degos, and A. Dejean, Nature (London) 347:558-561, 1990). This result demonstrates that the two different types of hybrid mRNA can be transcribed from this breakpoint. We screened a non-APL cDNA library and identified a 2.8-kb myl cDNA. This cDNA is able to encode a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 78,450. Alternative splicing of the myl gene which resulted in myl proteins with different C terminals was found. Southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA isolated from 17 APL patients by using the myl DNA probe demonstrated that the myl gene in 12 samples was rearranged. Northern (RNA) blot analysis of RARA gene expression in two APL RNA samples showed abnormal mRNA species of 4.2 and 3.2 kb in one patient and of 4.8 and 3.8 kb in another patient; these were in addition to the normal mRNA species of 3.7 and 2.7-kb. The myl DNA probe detected a 2.6-kb abnormal mRNA in addition to the normal mRNA species of 3.2, 4.2, and 5.5 kb. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated that both RARA/myl and myl/RARA were coexpressed in samples from three different APL patients.

Several different aFGF mRNA species resulting from alternative splicing have been reported. These results suggest that the gene structure and regulatory mechanism for gene expression of aFGF are complex. As a first step toward understanding aFGF gene structure, we have isolated nine overlapping genomic DNA clones spanning 54 kbp and determined the complete DNA sequences of all three coding exons. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences between the human and bovine DNA showed that the sequence similarity extended 2400 bp downstream from the coding region. Cloning of the aFGF gene allowed us to characterize this locus in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) patients. A fraction of ANLL patients (10-20%) have a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 5, whose distal breakpoint overlaps the aFGF locus. Therefore, a prospective cohort of eight ANLL patients was screened using three different repetitive sequence-free probes derived from the aFGF locus. Using beta-globin gene as a normalization probe for hybridizing band intensities, we conclude that there is no allelic loss or gross rearrangement within the 40 kbp stretch of the aFGF gene locus in ANLL patients with or without 5q- deletion. Consistent with this observation, the aFGF mRNA was not detected in the mononuclear cells derived from either an ANLL patient or a normal individual as judged by the reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. We also identified a DNA fragment, 10.7 kbp upstream from the first coding exon of human aFGF, whose sequence is conserved in both the primate and rodent genomes.

PFGE analysis localized Fli-1 within 240 kb of the ets-1 proto-oncogene on mouse chromosome 9 and human chromosome 11q23, suggesting that ets-1 and Fli-1 arose from a common ancestral gene by gene duplication. The involvement of the murine Fli-1, Spi-1, and avian v-ets genes in erythroleukemia induction suggests that activation of ets gene family members plays an important role in the progression of these multistage malignancies.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, Blotting, Northern, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Cell Transformation, Viral, DNA, Friend murine leukemia virus, Genetic Linkage, Hematopoiesis, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Multigene Family, Proto-Oncogene Mas, Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1, Proto-Oncogene Proteins, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets, Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid, Transcription Factors, Transcription, Genetic, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['M31698', 'M31699', 'M61223', 'M61224', 'M61225', 'X57334', 'X59421', 'X60231', 'X60232', 'X60233']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,M31698

The monocytic cell line THP-1 was used as a model system to study the production of a particular gelatinase. Upon stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) the cells differentiated to the adherent phenotype and produced significant amounts of a 96-kD gelatinase in a dose-dependent way. The secretion rate was maximal between 12 and 24 h after induction. Study of gelatinase mRNA steady state levels showed that the synthesis of THP-1 gelatinase is regulated by PMA at transcriptional or posttranscriptional levels. Stimulation of signal transduction pathways with other substances, including calcium ionophore A 23187, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and dexamethasone, were ineffective in inducing gelatinase mRNA or enzyme activity.

The clk gene product contains a C-terminal cdc2-like kinase domain, most similar to the FUS3 catalytic domain. The Clk protein, expressed in bacteria, becomes efficiently phosphorylated in vitro on tyrosine as well as serine/threonine, and phosphorylates the exogenous substrate poly(glu, tyr) on tyrosine.

This was confirmed by Northern blot analysis which also provided evidence that the three mRNAs originated by use of different polyadenylation signals of which seven were found in the longest cDNA we analyzed.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Blotting, Northern, Blotting, Southern, Cells, Cultured, Cloning, Molecular, Exons, Glycophorins, Humans, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Liver, Molecular Sequence Data, RNA, Messenger, Templates, Genetic, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['X51798']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,X51798

The cDNA had an open reading frame encoding 662 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 75,590. Three independent clones revealed minor heterogeneities in their DNA sequences. Thus, in three positions of the deduced amino acid sequence, there is a choice between two different amino acids.

The 12-lipoxygenase cDNA recognized a 3.0-kilobase mRNA species in platelets and human erythroleukemia cells (HEL cells). Phorbol 12-tetradecanoyl 13-acetate induced megakaryocytic differentiation of HEL cells and 12-lipoxygenase activity and increased mRNA for 12-lipoxygenase. The identity of the cloned 12-lipoxygenase was assured by expression in a mammalian cell line (COS cells). Human platelet 12-lipoxygenase has been difficult to purify to homogeneity.

Mature platelet GPIIb is processed from a single precursor peptide into a disulfide-linked GPIIb alpha and GPIIb beta chain. To study possible mechanisms which could determine ligand specificity of the GPIIb-IIIa complex we investigated whether there are multiple forms of GPIIb mRNA by screening an unamplified lambda gt10 human erythroleukemia cell cDNA library. Four GPIIb clones were isolated and sequenced. Two contained a 102-nucleotide in-frame deletion corresponding to 34 amino acids in the extracellular domain of GPIIb beta. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of human erythroleukemia cell cDNA confirmed the presence of two different transcripts. Normal genomic DNA sequence was shown to contain consensus splice-donor and splice-acceptor sites indicating a 102-base pair exon that is spliced in or out. Using primers specific for either transcript, both forms of GPIIb mRNA were identified by the polymerase chain reaction in normal human platelets and megakaryocytes, but not in reticulocytes or two white blood cell lines.

This peptide was then used to elicit rabbit antibodies for study of the translation and post-translational modification of this gene product in hematopoietic cells.

After a 20-min to 1-h chase, this [35S]methionine- or [35S]sulfate-labeled proteoglycan intermediate lost its antigenicity, presumably due to proteolysis of its N terminus.

We have examined the DNA-protein interactions within the first intron of the c-myb gene and identified a 1.0-kilobase region that could be responsible for its transcriptional regulation. Using the mobility-shift assay, we show a direct correlation between the extent of sequence-specific protein binding to intron 1 DNA fragments, and c-myb mRNA levels in different cell types. During dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of mouse erythroleukemic cells, there was a dramatic decrease in these nuclear factors that correlated with the decrease in the levels of c-myb mRNA.

In this homologous part of the genes, GPB lacks one exon due to a point mutation at the 5' splicing site of the third intron, which inactivates the 5' cleavage event of splicing and leads to ligation of the second to the fourth exon. Following these very homologous sequences, the genomic sequences for GPA and GPB diverge significantly and no homology can be detected in their 3' end sequences. The transition site from homologous to nonhomologous sequences can be localized within Alu repeat sequences. The analysis of the Alu sequences and their flanking direct repeat sequences suggest that an ancestral genomic structure has been maintained in the GPA gene, whereas the GPB gene has arisen from the acquisition of 3' sequences different from those of the GPA gene by homologous recombination at the Alu repeats during or after gene duplication.","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Biological Evolution, Cell Line, DNA, Neoplasm, Genes, Glycophorins, Humans, Introns, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Molecular Sequence Data, Recombination, Genetic, Restriction Mapping, Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid, Sialoglycoproteins",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['M24123', 'M24124', 'M24125', 'M24126', 'M24127', 'M24128', 'M24130', 'M24131', 'M24132', 'M24133', 'M24134', 'M24135', 'M24136', 'M24137']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,M24123

EDN is a distinct cationic protein of the eosinophil's large specific granule known primarily for its ability to induce ataxia, paralysis, and central nervous system cellular degeneration in experimental animals (Gordon phenomenon). The open reading frame encodes a 134-amino acid mature polypeptide with a molecular mass of 15.5 kDa and a 27-residue amino-terminal hydrophobic leader sequence. The sequence of the mature polypeptide is identical to that reported for human urinary ribonuclease [Beintema, J. J., Hofsteenge, J., Iwama, M., Morita, T., Ohgi, K., Irie, M., Sugiyama, R.

Both EDN and the related granule protein, eosinophil cationic protein, have ribonucleolytic activity; sequence similarities among EDN, eosinophil cationic protein, ribonucleases from liver, urine, and pancreas, and angiogenin define a ribonuclease multigene family. mRNA encoding EDN was detected in uninduced HL-60 cells and was up-regulated in cells induced toward eosinophilic differentiation with B-cell growth factor 2/interleukin 5 and toward neutrophilic differentiation with dimethyl sulfoxide. EDN mRNA was detected in mature neutrophils even though EDN-like neurotoxic activity is not found in neutrophil extracts.

Mouse Friend erythroleukemia cells offer an interesting model to analyze the erythroid-specific expression of ferritin genes for comparison with the liver, an iron-storing tissue. cDNA clones for mouse ferritin H and L subunits have been isolated and sequenced. The two subunits have very similar calculated masses, 20.9 and 20.6 kDa for H and L, respectively. Electrophoretic analysis of the subunits encoded by the cDNA 1) allows unambiguous identification of mouse ferritin subunits; 2) clearly shows that mouse H and L chains can make heteropolymers in vitro; and 3) demonstrates that, at least in vitro, free subunits can coexist with subunits polymerized into complete shells. The mouse ferritin gene family displays a variable degree of complexity, ranging from three homologous sequences for the H genes to 10-14 homologous loci for the L genes. Transcription of ferritin genes exhibits tissue-specific difference. Nuclear transcriptional run-off experiments show that the L gene is more actively transcribed in the liver than in Friend erythroleukemia cells at different stages of maturation. The accumulation of the H subunit mRNA which results from dimethyl sulfoxide induction of Friend cells is the consequence of an increase in the transcription rate of the H gene. However, the H gene mRNA is transcribed at a similar rate in the liver and in induced Friend cells although 5-fold more mRNA accumulates in these cells. Therefore, there is a tissue-specific regulation of mouse ferritin expression at both the transcription and mRNA stability levels.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Animals, Base Sequence, Blotting, Southern, Cloning, Molecular, DNA, Erythropoiesis, Ferritins, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Liver, Macromolecular Substances, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Molecular Weight, RNA, Messenger, Transcription, Genetic, Tumor Cells, Cultured",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['J04716', 'M24509']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,J04716

We isolated from this library a 1.6-kilobase full-length clone designated b4 whose corresponding mRNA was greatly increased in abundance in cytoplasmic RNA under these conditions. Dideoxy sequencing revealed that this mRNA encoded MONAP (monocyte-derived neutrophil-activating peptide), a 10-kilodalton monokine with neutrophil-specific chemotactic and enzyme-releasing activities. The 3' untranslated region of this mRNA was found to be 1.2 kilobases long and possessed nine copies of the AUUUA sequence known to be associated with regulation of mRNA stability. Actinomycin D chase experiments yielded evidence that cytoplasmic stabilization was one of the means of regulation of MONAP expression. Analysis of cytoplasmic poly(A)- RNA revealed the presence of several discrete truncated species that shared a common 5' end and appeared to be intermediates of degradation. S1 mapping showed that the 3' ends of these molecules were distributed throughout the 3' untranslated region, preferentially in A + U-rich regions, broadly correlating with the distribution of AUUUA sites. Nuclear run-on experiments indicated that transcriptional induction accounted for less than 15% of the accumulation of MONAP mRNA. This mRNA was induced in HL60 cells by treatment with several differentiation-inducing agents: 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-myristate alone, sodium butyrate, vitamin D3, and dimethyl sulfoxide.

These results indicate that there is a basal rate of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation of tissue-specific mRNAs in adult and embryonic tissues. In addition to revealing sequence information, it is possible to generate a desired in vitro translation product by incorporating a translation initiation signal into the appropriate PCR primer.

These murine HMG-I(Y) genes contain a large (at least 890 base pairs) exon that includes most, or all, of the 3'-untranslated region; whereas the much shorter 5'-untranslated region and amino acid coding sequences are interrupted by at least one intron. A single size class (approximately 1700 nucleotides in murine cells and 2000 nucleotides in human cells) of HMG-I(Y) mRNAs was detected at high levels in total RNA extracts from rapidly dividing, transformed cells, but to a lesser extent, or not at all, in extracts from slowly or non-dividing cells.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Base Sequence, Blotting, Northern, Blotting, Southern, Cell Line, DNA, Genes, High Mobility Group Proteins, Humans, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Leukemia, Experimental, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Restriction Mapping, Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid, Species Specificity, Transcription, Genetic",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['J04179']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Comparative Study', attributes={'UI': 'D003160'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013486'})]",GENBANK,J04179

This gene encodes two closely related mRNAs; one, activated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 at an early stage of HL-60 differentiation, encodes a protein that has homology to mammalian FBPase, a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, although it does not exhibit its classical enzymatic activity. A second mRNA is activated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 mainly in peripheral blood monocytes. This mRNA is present in kidney as a unique transcript and encodes a protein with FBPase activity.

In 25% of the ALV-induced leukemic samples we have analyzed, acute retroviruses that have captured the activated erbB oncogene were released. The unusually high frequency at which erbB transduction occurs makes this an ideal system for studying the mechanism of oncogene transduction. In addition, these leukemic samples provide a rich source for the isolation of novel erbB-transducing viruses. We report here our characterization of several new erbB-transducing proviruses. The 5' recombination points of all these viruses mapped to the same intron in which proviral insertions cluster, supporting the hypothesis that transduction begins with proviral insertion near the oncogene. The 3' recombination points usually occurred within the 3' untranslated region downstream from the termination codon of the c-erbB gene. Three of the erbB-containing proviruses were molecularly cloned and analyzed in detail. Two of them were capable of releasing acute viruses, and interestingly, both retained poly(A) tracts of erbB messages in their genomes. A stretch of six adenosine residues in the ALV env gene appeared to mediate the 3' recombination events required for the generation of these viruses.

The sequence of pPB15 demonstrated that it coded for the 173 C-terminal residues of the 218 amino acids that comprise the mature NE protein, plus an additional 3' 60 base pairs prior to the in-frame stop codon, suggesting the NE mRNA contains sequences for a 20-residue C-terminal ""pro"" peptide that is not found in the mature protein.

In contrast, bone marrow precursor cells contained NE transcripts, suggesting the NE gene is expressed in blood precursor cells. In this regard, evaluation of HL-60 cells, a human cell line with myelomonocytic lineage features, demonstrated NE transcripts in resting cells and increased NE mRNA levels when the cells were induced toward the myelocytic lineage with dimethyl sulfoxide. However, when the HL-60 cells were induced toward the monocytic lineage with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, NE transcripts were lost even though transcripts for interleukin-1 beta were plentiful.

Two of these clones, lambda IIb1, from HEL cells, and lambda IIb2, from megakaryocytes, cross-hybridized and were selected for detailed analysis. The identification of these as authentic GPIIb clones was based on immunological criteria and confirmed by the presence of nucleotide sequences in each insert encoding for known protein sequences of platelet GPIIb. These clones contained inserts of 1.54 kb and 1.39 kb, respectively, with an overlapping sequence of 801 bp.

The present study was designed to compare the cDNA-derived protein sequences of the alpha-subunits of human FnR, VnR, and platelet GP IIb. cDNA clones for the alpha-subunit of the FnR (FnR alpha) were obtained from a human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cell library by using an oligonucleotide probe designed from a peptide sequence of platelet GP IIb. cDNA clones for platelet GP IIb were isolated from a cDNA expression library of human erythroleukemia cells by using antibodies. cDNA clones of the VnR alpha-subunit (VnR alpha) were obtained from the HUVE cell library by using an oligonucleotide probe from the partial cDNA sequence for the VnR alpha. Translation of these sequences showed that the FNR alpha, the VnR alpha, and GP IIb are composed of disulfide-linked large (858-871 amino acids) and small (137-158 amino acids) chains that are posttranslationally processed from a single mRNA. A single hydrophobic segment located near the carboxyl terminus of each small chain appears to be a transmembrane domain. The large chains appear to be entirely extracellular, and each contains four repeated putative Ca2+-binding domains of about 30 amino acids that have sequence similarities to other Ca2+-binding proteins. The identity among the protein sequences of the three receptor alpha-subunits ranges from 36.1% to 44.5%, with the Ca2+-binding domains having the greatest homology.

Friend erythroleukemia cell, and Sp2 cell DNA both showed an abnormal banding pattern in HpaII digests. Hybridization in situ to metaphase chromosomes showed that probed sequences were broadly interspersed along the arms of each mouse chromosome.

The unmethylated d(pCCGG) sites in Sp2 and Friend cells could then be assigned to polymorphic-repeated sequence groups within L1, homologous to the region spanned by BAM5 and R.

Construction of chimeric molecules between the transforming and the normal N-ras genes and subsequent biological and sequence analysis of these constructs revealed that the transforming gene was altered by a point mutation changing amino acid 12 of the N-ras protein from glycine to aspartic acid.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Alleles, Animals, Base Sequence, Cell Line, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Chimera, Cloning, Molecular, Fibroblasts, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Mice, Mutation, Oncogenes, Transfection",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['K03211', 'M10055']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,K03211
3935516,Isolation and characterization of a genomic DDD mouse interleukin-3 gene.,"Todokoro K, Yamamoto A, Amanuma H, Ikawa Y",Gene,{'Year': '1985'},"A chromosomal DNA segment containing the entire gene for interleukin-3 (IL-3) was isolated from DDD mouse erythroleukemia cells, and its gene organization and nucleotide sequence were determined. Enhancer-like sequences in the second intron and G + C-rich sequence in the 5'-flanking region may play a role in the regulation of tissue-specific and inducible gene expression. Southern blot analyses revealed that constitutively IL-3-producing WEHI-3 cells have the rearranged IL-3 gene, and that genomic DNAs prepared from the adult and fetal mouse liver have the same organization of the IL-3 gene. No IL-3 gene transcript was detected in the mouse erythroleukemia cells by Northern blot analysis.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Animals, Base Composition, Base Sequence, Cloning, Molecular, DNA, Genes, Interleukin-3, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Lymphokines, Mice",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['M14394', 'M20128']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,M14394
6194897,Multiple origins of transcription in the 4.5 Kb upstream of the epsilon-globin gene.,"Allan M, Lanyon W G, Paul J",Cell,"{'Year': '1983', 'Month': 'Nov'}","By a combination of primer extension and S1 mapping, we have identified and characterized at least nine epsilon-globin initiation sites in the 4.5 kb upstream of the canonical mRNA cap site. These occur in four regions, -65 to -250, -900, -1480, and -4500 bp from the translation initiation codon ATG. Transcripts from eight sites yield sufficient material for direct RNA analysis and in all of these instances the molecules are capped. Approximately 10%-15% of epsilon-globin transcripts originate from these upstream sites in both an erythroleukemic cell line and purified erythroblasts from first-trimester human embryos. In three established cell lines derived from adult non-erythroid tissue, low levels of transcription of the epsilon-globin gene occur, but the RNA molecules originate exclusively from one of the upstream sites identified in erythroid cells. These findings suggest modification of the current models of transcription of globin genes.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Cell Line, Codon, DNA, DNA Restriction Enzymes, Endonucleases, Erythroblasts, Genes, Globins, Humans, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, Nucleic Acid Hybridization, RNA, RNA Caps, Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases, Transcription, Genetic",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['J00093', 'J00094', 'J00096', 'J00158', 'J00159', 'J00160', 'J00161', 'J00162', 'J00163', 'J00164', 'J00165', 'J00166', 'J00167', 'J00168', 'J00169', 'J00170', 'J00171', 'J00172', 'J00173', 'J00174', 'J00175', 'J00177', 'J00178', 'J00179', 'K01239', 'K01890', 'K02544', 'M18047', 'M19067', 'X00423']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'N'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'})]",GENBANK,J00093
6304538,Nucleotide sequence of cloned cDNA of human c-myc oncogene.,"Watt R, Stanton L W, Marcu K B, Gallo R C, Croce C M, Rovera G",Nature,{'MedlineDate': '1983 Jun 23-29'},"Like other transforming genes of retroviruses, the v-myc gene of the avian virus, MC29, has a homologue in the genome of normal eukaryotic cells. The human cellular homologue, c-myc, located on human chromosome 8, region q24 leads to qter (refs 1, 2), is translocated into the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on human chromosome 14 (ref. 3) in Burkitt's lymphoma, suggesting that c-myc has a primary role in transformation of some human haematopoietic cells. In addition, c-myc is amplified in the human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, HL60 (refs 6, 7) which also contains high levels of c-myc mRNA. Recently, Colby et al. reported the nucleotide sequence of the human c-myc DNA isolated from a genomic recombinant DNA library derived from human fetal liver. This 4,053-base pair (bp) sequence includes two exons and one intron of the myc gene, and the authors have suggested the existence of a human c-myc mRNA of 2,291 nucleotides that has a coding capacity for a protein of molecular weight (Mr) 48,812. We have approached the problem of accurately defining the characteristics of the human c-myc mRNA and c-myc protein by determining the sequence of the c-myc cDNA isolated from a cDNA library prepared from mRNA of a clone of the K562 human leukaemic cell line. K562 cells are known to contain c-myc mRNA which is similar in size to the c-myc mRNA of other human cell types. We report here the sequence of 2,121 nucleotides of a human c-myc mRNA and demonstrate that its 5' noncoding sequence does not correspond to the sequence of the reported genomic human sequence. However, our data confirm that the intact human c-myc mRNA can encode a 48,812-Mr protein with a sequence identical to that reported by Colby et al.","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Cell Line, Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X, Cloning, Molecular, DNA, DNA Restriction Enzymes, Humans, Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute, Oncogenes, Protein Biosynthesis, RNA, Messenger, Transcription, Genetic",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['V00568']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,V00568

Nucleotide sequence analysis of these cDNA clones revealed a coding sequence that corresponds perfectly to the independently derived amino acid sequence of the human zeta-globin chain. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence of human zeta-globin cDNA with that of human alpha-globin cDNA confirmed previous estimates of very distant evolutionary divergence between the human zeta- and alpha-globin genes. Nevertheless, the human zeta-globin cDNA sequence shares a remarkable similarity to that of the alpha-globin gene in its codon usage, high G + C base composition, and lack of bias against usage of CG dinucleotides.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","Base Composition, Base Sequence, Cell Line, Cloning, Molecular, Codon, DNA, Embryo, Mammalian, Genes, Globins, Humans, Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute, RNA, Messenger",[],"ListElement([{'DataBankName': 'GENBANK', 'AccessionNumberList': ['M24173']}], attributes={'CompleteYN': 'Y'})","[StringElement('Comparative Study', attributes={'UI': 'D003160'}), StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'}), StringElement(""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", attributes={'UI': 'D013485'}), StringElement(""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", attributes={'UI': 'D013487'})]",GENBANK,M24173
